We also have finite state machines, which are discrete. Crucially, these two interact. Consider: flying a plain and an astroid approaches (continuous); the plane's computer needs to adjust suddenly (discretized). Making matters even more complicated, agents compete within these systems (Consider: an attacker is *trying* to crash the plane). GDS sweeps all of these concerns, *and their interactions*, into a single theoretical framework. Equilibria are their main tool. In GDS, a \"globally asymptotic state equilibrium\" means a tendancy to not fuck up, even when crazy shit happens.\n\n<@753720709032968213> mentioned some of Zargham's work at our last meet up, and i've been talking to him about non-DAO stuff and stumbled upon this paper.\n\n<@676640406875930644> i *highly* recommend this paper to you specifically. there are clear applications to security analysis.\n\nYESSS one of my favorites\n\nI have these all printed out and in my backpack right now.\n\nrelated - why traditional engineering is not so safe: https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2908/chapter/78964/Questioning-the-Foundations-of-Traditional-Safety\n\nmy math is a little rough, does anyone know the english translation of something like\n\nperhap <@753720709032968213> ?\n\nis this like saying \"f is a function that maps any two possible states and admissible inputs (edit: given `x` which is the input that tick) to the next state?\"\n\nso i guess it would follow that `Image(f)` is the set of all possible next states, given the current state and admissible inputs\n\nthis is so fucking cool\n\nalso, i'm not sure i understand what the \"converging to\" part of this definition is doing\n\nYES YOU ARE CORRECT\n\nyes\n\nnice video lecture about this stuff: https://youtu.be/vid78CU-gsE\n\ni really like the description of \"Event Sequence time\" here\n\nYes!\n\nI am at Zargham's house now in Albany!\n\nI feel like when you read it outloud or just write it out it helps a lot!\n\n\n\nBlockscience house! (Zargam's basement)\n\nyou are a maniac\n\n<@755585146140491956> i'm finding this video series to be extremely helpful in transitioning the paper to something practical: https://youtu.be/8t-FKDzrnmA\n\nthis slide is wildly cool\n\nlike, this is all reasonably intuitive, but i LOVE this framing of the problem\n\non to part three next lol\n\n<@753720709032968213> / <@755585146140491956> wanna meet up next week and try to make a little GDS and model it?\n\ncool, will give it a watch\n\nabsolutely, i'm quite free\n\nwe can come up with a toy problem or try to constrain something with our contracts.\n\nnice!\n\none idea I have is to try and extend their AMM analysis with RAW DAO's fee split mechanism\n\nthough that depends on having a copy of the second paper in their series that does not appear to be published yet\n\nthough, i also hear <@753720709032968213> is in the basement ;)\n\nyeah, if we could get a preprint we could even contribute to the paper before it comes out\n\n(if we find something interesting)\n\n<@676640406875930644> i think you should feel empowered to email the authors on any paper and ask for a preprint. you can flatter them and explain your project idea\n\npapers have email addresses in the affiliation exactly for people like you to do this\n\nthe fact that other established scholars also use those emails to contact paper authors (usually to nitpick about some parochial concern) is an unfortunate but unavoidable side effect\n\nyes and yes -- I can ask mz\n\nanother way of sating this is `x' =f(x,u)` where `x` belongs to the space `X` and `u` belongs to `Ux`. The \"big X\" is the \"statespace\" and the `Ux` is what we can call the admissible inputs -- if you think of those inputs as \"actions\" its like saying these `Ux` is all the actions that are possible (or allowed to be taken) when the current state of the system is `x`. In this notation `x'` is the new point that you land in if you were at `x` then the admissible action `u` was taken.\n\nthis is a pretty abstract construction but one implementation is calling a method on a smart contract.  `X` is the data structure in the smart contract and `x` is the current value of that struct. Given the current value there are many possible valid transactions `Ux`,  and we choose exactly one of them `u` when you execute that transaction -- then afterward the smart contract struct is in state `x'`\n\n<@676640406875930644> if you're around for chat - anytime\n\n<@755585146140491956> <@676640406875930644> when free for zargham call?\n\nlike -- sunday or monday anytime\n\nSunday (tomorrow) would work great for me!\n\nalso, sent an email asking for part II\n\nso now we wait with crossed fingers\n\nYAY\n\nUHHH hahaha Z says \"we're getting together at oxford (November) to write part II!:\"\n\naha monday also works great :)\n\nor tuesday\n\ni'm just going to remain on vacation until i feel like i've learned this stuff\n\nso >= wednesday also works :)\n\nYAY\n\nokay - free tomorrow and also now lol\n\nthink i want to figure out the crosswalk example before we try one ourselves\n\nstill working through part III of the videos\n\nso ideally after that\n\ni.e. tomorrow :)\n\nyay perfect tomorow let me know when, lololol\n\nThrilled you're into this\n\nQUITE\n\nvery glad you and nick introduced me!\n\nstill not sure if it will work for us, but WAY more promising than any other formal verification technique for these things than I have seen before\n\nYAY yes yes\n\nright?

I think we (DAO DAO) find ourselves asking similar questions to the ones that probably motivated this work - how can we run a business that operates a lot like SaaS without extracting rent from our customers? How can we come up with some objective function to maximize, but whose maximization should not become socially or ecologically deleterious?\n\nQuestions I asked: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12KAzuwEtN1NkRQZC1sRJJdbA684ytE3ggXAVdZdrLT8/edit\n\nDoing this now!

I think there are a lot of learnings we can apply to our own systems\n\n<@898769611200274482> Can I use this for the episode NOTES!??!!?

Getting better at this!\n\nquick recap of meeting with <@451859116961300501> : we're going to proceed with installing the telescope bot in our server, unless anyone has any issues with this (but from previous discussions, people have seemed to support it.) The way you interact with the bot is by emoji-tagging certain posts that you believe should be flagged for ethnographic research, but we need to be intentional about what kinds of posts we want to tell everyone to tag (what questions are we trying to ask about our governance? what are we trying to discover?). We can discuss this more in the upcoming community call.\n\nno worries!\n\nDAOchem: DAOchem is a mixture of on- and off-chain governance data sources which react to produce a holistic view of DAO governance produced by Lucia Korpas with an ETH Denver hackathon team (Sage Shelton, Son Nguyen, and stryker). We are working to integrate data on smart contract parameters, voting activity, Twitter activity, and contributor sentiment to help DAO creators, contributors and researchers understand the governance landscape\nhttps://daogovdata.info/\n\nAn overarching question driving our work is: are DAOs \"working\" right now? Are they what they say they are? Are they achieving their stated goals? How do DAO contributors feel about their experiences? To answer these questions, we're less interested in the nitty-gritty operational details specific to each DAO and more in patterns of governance structures and behaviors that might be observed across DAOs. In particular:\n\nWhat governance systems are DAO founders choosing to implement, with what \"laws\"?\nIn what (measurable) ways are DAO members participating in governance? Does DAO member activity relate to the chosen systems?\nHow satisfied are DAO members with their own experiences and with the health/success of the DAO overall? How do these experiences relate to the chosen systems?\n\nHi, I'll try to answer this for NetaDAO since it's 'sort of' my wing, but I leave this all open for other NetaDAO members to add to/correct me on.\n\n1. Are DAOs \"working\" right now?\nWe are working and right now we are forming a legal entity for the DAO since the DAO is engaged in partnerships of selling NFTs, which will involve the DAO in tax events that need clear jurisdiction. We hope to have the LLC established by January.\n\n2. Are DAOs what they say they are?\nI can't speak for others, but imo, NetaDAO is a true DAO: the people building around NETA are from all over the world and united by NETA drop. Nobody has centrally organized or planned growth or membership, and we don't want to do so going forward. NetaDAO should remain a proto-DAO, grassroots and bottom-up.  \n\n3. What governance systems are DAO founders choosing to implement, with what \"laws\"?\nDue to regulatory concerns, we are considering a \"law\" that members cannot have more than 10% control of NetaDAO's voting power, with a contract(?) that automatically limits members' stake if they exceed the cap. (This doesn't solve a sybil attack, but it solves the regulatory concern for now). Perhaps the other major \"law\" of NetaDAO is that, as a nonprofit, it will not distribute revenue to stakers. (We are researching setting up a for-profit entity that might have this capability, but time will tell.)\n\nIn thinking about NetaDAO's organizational structure, I have been looking to hybridize traditional business, university, and political party structures that are relevant, with an eye (as mentioned) toward respecting growth and enabling members to get involved. Right now we have drafted a handful of Verticals with subDAOs under each, and the subDAOs are comprised of (at least) tech leads, support, and advisory/public oversight roles (i.e., nontechnical but interested members from NetaDAO community).\n\n4. In what (measurable) ways are DAO members participating in governance? Does DAO member activity relate to the chosen system?\nNobody has put up a spam proposal so far, so I think our proposal deposit is at least high enough. We will have our first real governance activity when we try to ratify the NetaDAO Operating Agreement.\n\n5. How satisfied are DAO members with their own experiences and with the health/success of the DAO overall? How do these experiences relate to the chosen systems?\nI don't have any data on this one, but I hope (and believe) that members who have attended the weekly meetings have felt welcomed and able to contribute. I know that two people have volunteered to work on business/tax/legal issues with me, and I believe that there is a general interest to get involved in a DAO really trying to experiment and explore what a DAO can be and do.\n\nWow! Thank you for this!\n\n<@753720709032968213> / <@755585146140491956> / <@477634436586799104> / whoever else was interested in the telescope bot stuff, maybe we can just follow up in our next chat with Ellie (she wanted to have a call with us after we set up the bot)\n\nso next step is to just set up the bot, which I can do\n\nhttps://medium.com/metagov/introduction-documentation-of-the-telescope-bot-cfd084beba87\n\nHooray!\n\nhttps://medium.com/sourcecred/introduction-to-sourcecred-7665297af715\n\nCheck out this article on Sourcred \"SourceCred is an open-source technology for organizing communities.\"\n\n\"A core issue here is that fairly tracking contributions is hard. In a group of five or six people, it\u2019s easy to remember who did what, and to recognize them accordingly. But in a team of fifty or sixty, it\u2019s really hard to know about all the different kinds of value that people contributed.\"\n\nsourcecred is rly interesting\n\nAlso: here's a spreadsheet of DAOs https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16IDgIyPcfwJGG-zmXeMAenYbePQVHkc2P6WCwKEZgpk/edit#gid=0\n\nJust reading a lot of Kelsie Nabben's writings on DAOs right now and getting some interesting links out of them!\n\nhttps://kelsienabben.substack.com/p/experiments-in-algorithmic-governance?s=w\n\nExperiments in algorithmic governance continue\nTrying not to fail at Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\n\n\n\nDAO governance: Technical on-chain and social off-chain\n\nScholars have referred to two main types of DAOs as participatory and algorithmic. Participatory DAOs are managed by distributed consensus through smart contracts to signal the preferences of members. Algorithmic DAOs aim to be entirely algorithmically governed, with the underlying smart contracts dictating the entire functionality of a DAO.\n\nAn example of a participatory DAO might be GitcoinDAO, which has a council of governors, which can allocate governance tokens to stewards, deliberates proposals on forums, votes on \u201cSnapshot\u201d (an \u201coff-chain\u201d voting tool), and then executed voted proposals, such as allocating funds. An example of an algorithmic DAO is DxDAO, which launched with no pre-defined members, and is completely community run without any intervention of a project or team, which controls a decentralised trading protocol and other DeFi tools.

Data Driven Economic Systems\nCryptoeconomic systems provide near real-time data of on-chain economic activities, and may govern access\nrights or provide proofs related to data stored off-chain. The advancement in machine learning and system identification methods over the past decade has increased our capacity for creating novel, useful models in across a wide\nrange of applications [Jordan and Mitchell 2015], and in the context of economics [Mullainathan and Spiess 2017]\nin particular. This, for the first time, allows for almost real time steering of these economies and a level of applied\ncybernetics that was not possible before. Furthermore, it increases the precision of modeling and measurement\nrequired for steering these economies. This results in a data driven regulatory process, as shown in Figure 5.\nHowever, the advances of machine learned models [Jordan and Mitchell 2015] is a consequence of the growth\nof the digital economy that captures a large amount of economic data. This data is largely controlled by large\ntech firms operating platform based services which are often subject to algorithmic bias [Garcia 2016], [Lewis\nand Westlund 2015],[S\u00e6tra 2019], [Von Foerster 2003]. The stateful nature of cryptoeconomic systems has the\npotential to cede control over data back to the users of these platforms, if privacy by design is considered in the\nmodeling of the cryptoeconomic systems and their applications [Voshmgir 2019a].\n\nhttps://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e\n\nhere's another essay that I found to be really nice\n\n\n\nWeb3 project without loops. The challenge is dwindling $TOKEN supply and no long-term sustainability.\n\nThe main problem with this is that the founding team needs to continually dip into its supply of tokens to fund itself. That supply continues to dwindle, especially if the project has to pivot towards hitting product-market fit. With each dilution event, the founders\u2019 incentive to make the project succeed is further diminished. If the supply gets badly reduced, the team will need to sell company stock or a second token, which then risks misalignment of incentives.\n\nCan we do better? The image below shows an improvement, which some Web3 projects are doing. Taking a cue from businesses and nations, it introduces revenue generation (bottom right). Revenue is then looped back to Workers, in a curated fashion (middle-left). Projects are chosen based on growth potential and alignment with the project\u2019s mission. Funding can go to the founding team and other project teams. They all perform *work* to grow the $TOKEN value and network revenue. And the loop continues.\n\n\n\nRevenue generation can draw on ideas from Web1 & Web2 businesses \u2014 but with less extractive rates. Importantly, the token must be designed such that its value rises as usage rises.\n\nBut there\u2019s still one big problem: too little revenue, too late. I\u2019ll elaborate.\n\nIf rates are too high, it will either get forked and re-deployed with lower rates, or it won\u2019t get adopted because it\u2019s seen as too extractive.\nIf rates are too low (and usage isn\u2019t sufficient) then revenue is too low.\nEither way, teams won\u2019t have enough funding to keep growing the project. They will stoically or heroically keep going for a while, until they can\u2019t feed their family. Some may pull through. And most will be forced to stop, at which point the project begins its fade into oblivion.\n\n(6) Web3 Sustainability / Growth Models \u2014 A Fuller Picture\nGood news! We can overcome the challenge of \u201ctoo little revenue, too late\u201d. It takes a key change: rather than disburse all the tokens at the beginning of the project, disburse a large fraction of tokens over a much longer period of time to the workers that are adding value to the project. This gives teams a longer runway to iterate towards product-market fit (PMF), and more funds to catalyze growth once PMF is achieved.\n\nI call this the Web3 Sustainability Loop. The image below illustrates this. It has parallels to successful nations and successful businesses. At its heart is a loop, designed for \u201csnowball effect\u201d growth of the ecosystem. The Workers (center) do *work* to help grow the Web3 Project Ecosystem (right). Apps and services generate revenue, using the Web3 project\u2019s tools. A non-extractive fraction of that revenue is looped back (arrow looping from right to left) as Network revenue to the Web3 community: to Buy & Burn $TOKEN (bottom left) and back to workers curated by the community according (center-left). To catalyze growth and ensure decent funding in early days, Network rewards (left) also feed to Workers.\n\n\n\nWeb3 sustainability/growth model including an \u201couter wrapper\u201d that includes $TOKEN disbursement over time as a tool, in addition to network revenue.\n\nHere\u2019s the loop, in words:\n\nProjects are proposed, and curated, by the community.\nProjects are funded by Network revenue, and Network reward.\nAs projects do *work* and add value, network revenue", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": {"channel": 1032788394893398026}, "index": 2, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "a46cc6b3-f29e-4990-8a0c-ec9c6a57c3ce", "node_info": {"start": 25141, "end": 38589}}, {"text": "generate revenue, using the Web3 project\u2019s tools.

This incentivizes projects to seek external funding, such as matching investments or quadratic funding.\"\n\nValue can only be added to an ecosystem if the core product being built (by core devs) has last-mile apps for users (by app devs), which users can discover and find useful (go-to-market work). It\u2019s a chain going from core product \u2192 dapps \u2192 discovery & usage \u2192 actual value add.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1300723135076093952?s=20&t=MSD9OSy34xRIMio_NBeA0w\n\nhere's a tweetstorm related to this article\n\nhttps://youtube.com/clip/UgkxXnMHir7wy6sxD1MQ4mofl0zQmn-1ojMu\n\n\ud83e\udde0 \ud83d\udcaf  <@753720709032968213> would love to do another lunch n learn sometime about your learnings\n\nOhh good idea!!\n\nI\u2019ll be back mid-December\n\nLet\u2019s do one then like the 11th\n\ni'll be back from india dec 18th!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/nathanlawkc/status/1596842009364500481 , not sure if there's much research but found it interesting \ud83d\ude42\n\nNICE! ---- When k < 0, the space expands forever.

H \u2261 \n\u0227 / a\n is the Hubble parameter.\n\nThe Hubble parameter can change over time if other parts of the equation are time dependent (in particular the mass density, the vacuum energy, or the spatial curvature). Evaluating the Hubble parameter at the present time yields Hubble's constant which is the proportionality constant of Hubble's law. Applied to a fluid with a given equation of state, the Friedmann equations yield the time evolution and geometry of the universe as a function of the fluid density.\n\na is the scale factor which is taken to be 1 at the present time. k is the current spatial curvature (when a = 1). If the shape of the universe is hyperspherical and Rt is the radius of curvature (R0 at the present), then a = \nRt / R0. If k is positive, then the universe is hyperspherical. If k = 0, then the universe is flat. If k is negative, then the universe is hyperbolic.\n\nHere's a cool post on it: https://blogs.futura-sciences.com/e-luminet/2015/05/03/rise-big-bang-models-3-friedmanns-dynamical-solutions/\n\n<@904452225554874379> good to see you today!

I find their docs / process very interesting. i think we probably could learn a fair bit from these folks.\n\nI\u2019ve printed it out and I\u2019m bringing it on the plane. I feel that a few reads will stick it. It\u2019s important not to be intimidated by texts like this! It\u2019s like Feynman said - you don\u2019t just read a paper instantly - it takes some time. There are new words and phrases here, and the unfamiliar is the only thing getting in the way of reading. Skimming, relaxing, and just kind of floating over the paper without judging yourself for not immediately getting it is important.\n\nI know the author well. But! The first time I met him, my first thought was that he spoke like a textbook. And I thought he was trying to be official And unnecessarily formal! \n\nit was hard for me to hear through that. After talking with him a lot more, and then joining a working group with him around solving problems at the edge of what\u2019s possible with data DAOs - I will say that he has a very precise way of saying things, but once I\u2019ve gotten used to it the precision is incredible. I feel like once I read it I should make some notes and post some here!\n\nThanks much for sharing this. The (totally unexplained) analytic frame of 'political economy' via input/output or marginal analysis makes the argument somewhat wordy and inaccessible/obscure in places, but I appreciated its clarity on the challenges DAOs will face and how to prepare for them. \n\nSection IV is the most important imo and also the most concrete, so I'll share my pull-quotes from the more 'abstract'/generalized earlier sections:\n\nFrom Section I:\n\n> The questions of central relevance to governance of impersonal organizations are those surrounding disagreement or dispute among members.\n\nFrom Section II:\n\n> Therefore, the potential value of new organizational forms cannot be understood without a firm grounding in the efficiencies (and equities) that existing legacy systems have provided. The benefits of traditional organizational hierarchies can be summarized as attracting specialized individuals and concentrating their incentives to make value-adding decisions on the part of the larger whole. Furthermore, creating an organizational shell within which people can coordinate their productive activity has benefits in terms of reduction of transaction costs (Coase 1937) and incentive problems associated with investment (Williamson 1985; 2003).\u00a0\n\n> Thus, one overarching structural weakness to which DAOs are subject is those of the costs associated with democratization of decision-making among organization members. In many contexts, this low engagement is rational \u2013 it is inefficient to vote on the operating and governance decisions of every organization against which someone has a claim against future returns or output.\n\n>  Nonetheless, these existing systems of private governance have their own serious drawbacks, which makes the narrative thus far unfair to DAOs\u2019 potential. This is for two reasons: intrinsic (ideological) valuations and the possibility for ongoing institutional innovation. These also provide the basis for identification of the set of core values likely to create a community constitution whose formalization (and ongoing gap filling role in cases of Knightian uncertainty) is one that is a direct input to resilience, as a function of the internal political economy that this constitution reflects and thus shapes in an ongoing sense.\n\n> Therefore, the costs are lower to DAO organization than a strictly economic calculus would suggest due to the tendency for those engaged in these communities to intrinsically value the process itself, and that the sustainability of a DAO\u2019s governance will hinge on how well it can attract members who have this intrinsic motivation (alongside economic or philanthropic alignment with the DAOs purpose). This intrinsic valuation for DAO governance means that a subset of DAO projects will succeed in overcoming the relative inefficiencies of decentralized governance noted thus far.\n\n> Therefore, there are dynamic reasons to be cautiously optimistic about the institutional development that is likely to occur as DAOs emerge, compete for members, occasionally spectacularly fail, and eventually converge upon efficient design features that enable them to capture private and philanthropic market share by finding a niche where this form of governance is more efficient, and/or is able to attract a subset of members (whether investors or donors) who are willing to pay a premium for this specific form of governance.\n\nhttps://advanced-hindsight.com/\n\nOh wow! This is amazing!\n\nFrom Section III:\n\n> The study of legal transitions identifies how any institutional change tends to create winners and losers compared to the status quo, a direct testament to how the outcome of any given collective choice process will be a subject of disagreement in part due to the way in which the change affects the balance of interests among organization members.\n\n> Notably, DAOs\u2019 constitutive choices tend to involve forms of democratic input as a function of network activity or staked value, which makes them necessarily reflect a form of constitutional ordering more so than traditional firm governance. This means DAOs will be subject to internal collective choice dilemmas at a greater level than the centralized autocratic decision-making that is associated with private economic organizations. More generally, an organization\u2019s chosen purpose, through reifying a constitutive set of shared values, defining an internal political economy, and a set of competing organizations which members can plausibly join, is a principal determinant of the heterogeneity of member\u2019s preferences with respect to collective", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": {"channel": 1032788394893398026}, "index": 3, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "a46cc6b3-f29e-4990-8a0c-ec9c6a57c3ce", "node_info": {"start": 38611, "end": 52288}}, {"text": "a subject of disagreement in part due to the way in which the change affects the balance of interests among organization members.\n\n> Notably, DAOs\u2019 constitutive choices tend to involve forms of democratic input as a function of network activity or staked value, which makes them necessarily reflect a form of constitutional ordering more so than traditional firm governance.

A chosen purpose for an organization greatly defines an internal plurality of interests whose gains and losses to any institutional change in turn partially determine the scope of institutional change that is possible. Similarly, like-minded individuals can disagree in good faith about how to proceed in cases of uncertainty, and the more the unforeseen event is unlike anything that came previously, the more this disagreement is likely.undefined\u00a0A plurality of visions as to how to proceed are thus themselves a critical source of disagreement for governance of large impersonal organizations. Finally, competitor\u2019s governance and production choices themselves constrain the choices of any given organization, such that a chosen purpose (through determining competitive substitute purposes) is also choosing a set of constraints of governance decisions that are possible to resolve political economic and uncertainty-related disputes within a given organization. This makes institutions to accommodate disagreement as necessary for all collective action organizations at impersonal scale, institutions whose value increases given divergence in shared values within a particular organization.\n\nThis last chunk essentially defines three sources of discord among DAO members: (1) the constitution of their shared values, with its differing interpretations, (2) the plurality of visions that these interpretations give rise to, and (3) the external frictions the organization's actions are liable to produce.\n\nThe fourth and final sections give examples and some institutional mechanisms for handling these disputes, which I'm still mulling over as they are directly related to NetaDAO's operating agreement that I'm helping draft.\n\nYou REALLY got the essence of this essay. Oh my gosh.\n\nThese notes totally make it possible for me to parse this work in a really solid way now.\n\nIn real life, Eric talks like he writes. It\u2019s pretty incredible.\n\n<a:OH_peepoNerd:850484888649859072>\n\nWould love to see the operating agreement if it\u2019s public at some point.\n\nI\u2019m personally running into an issue where myself and another party worked on a project, but organizational debt added up and the cybernetic feedback loop turned negative.\n\nI like how Eric points out the gap between starting a traditional org with a background of law or finance or business, and then the fact that anybody can create a DAO, yet not necessarily have the tools to do that organizational process Or any experience with procedure in this shape whatsoever. \n\nAnd that gap can get groups of well-meaning people into some pretty miserable interpersonal conditions and cycles. I\u2019m definitely not as articulate is eric on these points, which is why I\u2019m so interested in reading his work. I\u2019m really glad you got something out of this, and I am super impressed by the summary of points. It\u2019s going to be super helpful to me as well.\n\nI\u2019d love to see a diagram, or maybe just create one of this gap. People go to undergrad and graduate school just to be able to deal with the basics of these human complexities. People go to court over issues that are not well defined. And yet all of us, few who have degrees, and more importantly, experience in diplomacy, organization, bookkeeping, and law, are almost arbitrarily creating these social constructs, and then getting hit with organizational issues after the initial feel good period is done.\n\nI have an OA draft up under the NetaDAO #governance-legal channel. Once we officially get our LLC incorporation process going (I have to put up proposal today), we'll have a 30-day open 'Assembly' to hash out the OA more exactly. What I have on the OA (and our separate Org Chart) right now is mostly structural descriptions of where everything/everyone is. Section IV here has given me some ideas for thinking about handling disagreements and mediating issues among subDAOs/etc.\n\nI\u2019m on UTC -7 so super late for me but this has been really cool getting to learn more about what you\u2019re working on. I have to join the Discord and check it out.\n\nI feel there's a lot of openness on where the emphasis on \"autonomy\" happens or can be placed in a DAO. The essay presents DAOs as incurring higher operating costs on the assumption that the autonomy is that of the total DAO. I suppose one could also interpret 'DAO autonomy' as meaning a collective empowering the autonomy of its subunits or representative structures.\n\nThis ambiguity likewise exists around interpretations of the phrase \"We the People,\" where it's been argued (in the US) that \"the people\" is the pure/direct count of individuals OR the group of states. The Constitution didn't so much resolve the problem as accept both: the House of Representatives was supposed to be proportional to the population, while the Senate was a fixed representation of states.\n\nI've been thinking about all this recently as models for NetaDAO and for DAOs more generally, so I'm happy to geek out and share with others. <:PES5_NerdWow:827518508409683978>\n\ni really like the approach described here for budget selection:\n\nhttps://blog.colony.io/introducing-budgetbox/#thinking-inside-the-box\n\neffectively, they have voters \"play a game\" where they select pairwise preferences (i think X is more important than Y) for a subset of all possible pairs. they then aggregate those preferences into a budget distribution. this reminds me a fair bit of the recent Osmosis grants proposal and seems like a reasonably proposal for a better way to manage DAO budgeting.\n\nin our case, \"budget distribution\" would likely go to subDAOs who are then charged with executing within their budget\n\nI read over this conversation yesterday, printed out paper also, and really appreciated <@503057962852548608> notes too! (Thanks!)  Then today at a web3 Governance conference here in Melbourne I met Eric and found you\u2019re really right! He does talk like he rights. He is next level.\n\nIs there any info on how they actually set up their pairwise preference quizzes? I can imagine that going in a lot of directions.\n\ngreat question :) the stuff i saw there was pretty hazy. it seems like they give each person a random fixed-size selection of pair, and ranks their preference. then, they use (and i quote) \"machine learning\" to build some probability based ordering of the options which they turn into funding gauges.\n\nit's pretty hazy, but the article links to some additional material which may have the details\n\nI posted a rough draft of my Orientation to our Operating Agreement work over on the server. Hopefully I'll revise sections 2 and 4 before Monday, but would be interested in any feedback based on your research on organizational design if you have some time. <:PES_Embarrassed:643089267932790797> <:pepethumbsup:774587160731844649>\n\ncc <@904452225554874379>\n\nhttps://noidea.dog/glue\n\nGreat article about glue!\n\nReading research papers can be intimidating.\n\nThe key is not trying to understand everything in the first pass. Here is how to read papers in three steps:\n1. A first quick pass to assess the context, the quality, and the contribution of the paper.\n\n2. A second pass to grasp the main messages of the paper while ignoring the details such as proofs or derivations. Write down comments for the parts which are unclear.\n\n3. Read the whole paper, trying to re-create the reasoning of the authors.

The connection-oriented cluster matching model seems like a productive start for DAOs/chains that are planning to use subDAOs. The \"coarseness\"/abstraction of the argument left me wondering how exactly to measure such things as contributions and group belonging per se, but the proof of concept seems valid if those can be satisfactorily worked out.\n\nThe issue of measuring contributor contribution for Quadratic Funding (if it isn't simply a dollar/token amount, but also involves 'sweat equity' and other less fungible modes of input), is probably parallel to the problem in Weyl and Posner's Quadratic Voting formulas, in which voters are issued \"voice shares\" that they use to make their voices louder or quieter on certain issues... Weyl and Posner present this as a way of protecting minority rights outside judicial oversight, but that's only if you can issue 'voice shares' in a way that satisfies participants. It's possible to simply drain/fatigue some groups' shares by putting their rights up for referendum, thus depleting their input in other areas of policy. Put otherwise, the QV model might just as quickly accentuate extremism and polarization, especially since caring about more policy initiatives reduces the weight of your vote on any individual initiative. The same happens with measuring nonfungible contributions for QF, especially when people are contributing across multiple operational initiatives.\n\nAbsolutely agree about accentuating a gazillion micro-dystopias or worse -- I personally think commodified labor is the issue and something like a graph of work (directed, one can only hope *loopy thoughts*) could be an interesting data structure to use when formally defining notions of fairness or social choice\n\nWith a dependency graph of what is accomplished, one can more precisely specify the geometry of fairness, and retroactive compensation can proceed along the lines of free energy minimization principle or similar work graph traversal mechanism\n\nQF / QV come from a good place, but in the end can only operate within the ontologies of modern monetary theory or principal agent in a bureaucratic nation-state\n\nYep, I very much like the idea of tying organizational funding to 'consilience' or broad agreement across organizational members. And I found much to ponder on their proposal to weight consilience by clusters/groups vs rational isolated individuals. It seems that it will always be a 'political' issue how to measure groups and their overlaps, with an inescapable judicial component involved (even if it's handled by 'ordinary'/nontrained members).\n\nFor something completely(?) different: https://youtu.be/AP3zeHyWakw\n\nhttps://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/particle-lenia/\n\n> As we see, the total system energy is mostly decreasing through a series of phase transitions between different formations. Nevertheless there are intervals where the energy is increasing. Why is this happening? Shouldn't the system that follows the energy gradient, eventually find a stable local minima? Turns out that there is one subtle detail which makes the dynamics much more interesting. Each particle greedily minimizes its own energy without considering its influence on other particles.\n> [....]\n> We can see that the global optimization indeed drives the system into a stable low-energy state. Once we switch to the local rule, the system escapes this state and enters a dynamic attractor similar to the one from the previous simulation.\n\n<:pog:1034269207594020864>\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800919310067\n\nenergy sections are just excellent and echo / converge on many of the essential tenets of what we've been working on over at Plurigrid for many months\n\nAlso the money / debt parts are quite on point IMO!

This belief is subtly reinforced by the fact that many scientists still think the emergence of life was a fortuitous accident that required a good roll of the molecular dice, in a place where the conditions are just so, in a Universe where the laws of physics are just right.\n\nThe opposing view is that matter tends to organize itself according to general principles, making the eventual emergence of life inevitable. Such principles would not require any modifications of the laws of physics, but would come from a better understanding of how complex behaviour arises from the interaction of simple components.\n\nIn their book Into the Cool, Eric Schneider and Dorion Sagan claim that non-equilibrium thermodynamics provides the key principle that has been lacking. They review its application to topics ranging from fluid dynamics and meteorology to the origin of life, ecology, plant physiology, and evolutionary biology, and even speculate about its relevance to health, economics and metaphysics. The book contains a wealth of good references and is worth buying for this reason alone.\n\n\"The truly dangerous ideas in science tend to be those that threaten the collective ego of humanity and knock us further off our pedestal of centrality.\"\n\n\"The dangerous idea is this: the purpose of life is to disperse energy.\"\n\nhttps://www.edge.org/response-detail/10674#:~:text=More%20generally%2C%20as%20stated%20by,example%2C%20in%20temperature%20or%20pressure.\n\n\"Nobel laureate Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was one of the first to articulate the hypothesis, as part of his famous \"What is Life\" lectures in Dublin in 1943. More recently, Jeffrey Wicken, Harold Morowitz, Eric Schneider and others have taken this concept considerably further, buoyed by results from a range of studies, particularly within ecology. Schneider and Dorian Sagan provide an excellent summary of this hypothesis in their recent book, \"Into the Cool\".\"\n\n<@676640406875930644> re: wet bulb conditons\n\n\"If a thermometer is wrapped in a water-moistened cloth, it will behave differently. The drier and less humid the air is, the faster the water will evaporate. The faster water evaporates, the lower the thermometer's temperature will be relative to air temperature.:\n\n\"Water can evaporate only if the air around it can absorb more water. This is measured by comparing how much water is in the air to the maximum that could be in the air\u2014the relative humidity. 0% means the air is completely dry, and 100% means the air contains all the water it can hold in the present circumstances and it cannot absorb any more water (from any source).\"\n\n\"This is part of the cause of apparent temperature in humans. The drier the air, the more moisture it can take up beyond what is already in it, and the easier it is for extra water to evaporate. The result is that sweat evaporates more quickly in drier air, cooling down the skin faster. If the relative humidity is 100%, no water can evaporate, and cooling by sweating or evaporation is not possible.\"\n\nDefinition: The wet-bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that may be achieved by evaporative cooling of a water-wetted, ventilated surface.\n\n---\n\nAnyway -- there will be more of these!\n\n---\n\nBack to the \"Into the Cool\"\n\n\"The twist is to claim that the need to reduce energy gradients drives a tendency towards increasing complexity in both living and non-living systems. In their words: \u201cEven before natural selection, the second law \u2018selects\u2019, from the kinetic, thermodynamic, and chemical options available, those systems best able to reduce gradients under given constraints.\u201d For example, they argue that the reason a climax forest replaces an earlier transition forest is that it is more efficient at fixing energy from the Sun, which also reduces the temperature gradient. They claim that the competition to reduce gradients introduces a force for selection, in which less effective mechanisms to reduce gradients are replaced by more effective ones. They argue that this is the fundamental reason why both living and non-living systems tend to display higher levels of organization over time.\"\n\n\"This is an intriguing idea but I am not convinced that it makes sense. The selection process that the authors posit is never clearly defined, and they never explain why, or in what sense, it necessarily leads to increasing complexity. No one would dispute that the second law of thermodynamics is important for understanding the functioning of complex systems. Being out of equilibrium is a necessary condition for a physical phenomenon to display interesting complex behaviour, even if \u2018interesting\u2019 remains difficult to define. But the authors' claim that non-equilibrium thermodynamics explains just about everything falls flat. For example, consider a computer. No one would dispute that a power supply is essential. Even for a perfectly efficient computer, thermodynamics tells us that it takes at least kT ln2 energy units to erase a bit, where T is the temperature and k is the Boltzmann constant. But the need for power tells us nothing about what makes a laptop different from a washing machine. To understand how a computer works, and what it can and cannot do, requires the theory of computation, which is a logical theory that is disconnected from thermodynamics. The power supply can be designed by the same person who designs them for washing machines.\" https://www.nature.com/articles/436627a\n\nI'm interested in both the idea and the critiques of the idea\n\nI also like this one \"Life relies on the ability of matter to store information and to implement functional relationships, which allow organisms to maintain their form and execute purposeful behaviours that enhance their survival. Such complex order depends on the rules by which matter interacts. It may well be that many of the details are not important, and that there are general principles that might allow us to determine when the result will be organization and when it will be chaos. But this cannot be understood in terms of thermodynamics alone.\"\n\nfun stuff: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Is-the-climate-system-an-anticipatory-system-that-Rubin-Crucifix/9bb9f270adf88eda156b8852142b7fa41fd6dac5\n\n<@755585146140491956> <@676640406875930644> <@181607258512162816> <@898769611200274482> Here's the paper on Awe from the day before!\n\n<@755585146140491956> I tried writing every morning when waking up so far.\n\nIt's been amazing!\n\nyesss thank you for sending all this\n\nNP!\n\nlol.

There are several texts which have dealt with the havoc that language acquisition plays on human mirror neurons and the consequent damming of spontaneous human sympathy/emotion; I believe Rizzolatti (who won the Nobel for his work on mirror neurons) or one of his original team members has written about the rewiring of the brain due to language acquisition, good if you read Italian, but if not another important source is Angela Friederici's _Language in Our Brain: The Origins of a Uniquely Human Capacity._ I would argue it's through this sabotage of spontaneous affect by language that 'symbols' or 'the symbolic' as such becomes operative in human biology and especially in human societies/organizations (which are, I think this paper  would argue, themselves products of biology). It's worth noting imo that this rewiring happens between the ages of 3-11, when the child is not just mastering language but more specifically learning to use negation operators and to speak of what is not, of reality versus possibility or fantasy. For this reason there's a sempiternal dysfunction and disorientation to human reality.\n\nThis is really a minor point I'm making, but it ramifies down into a comment from Section 3.2:\n\n> But when trading stocks, playing video games or building shopping centers, there is no instinctual \u2018full\u2019 signal in modern brains - so we become addicted to the \u2018unexpected reward\u2019 of the next encounter, episode, or email, at an ever increasing pace\n\nI too question whether there are instinctual signals for anything as specific as \"trading stocks,\" \"playing video games,\" etc\u2014but I don't tie my suspicion to a \"stone-age mind\" hypothesis. Rather, I adopt a view of the human organism as primarily formed and responding to linguistically-bound and hence aim-inhibited drives rather than natural instincts\u2014desire wears Reason like a mask, and it is easy to interpret some masks as nature. What perhaps is most 'natural' to human nature is the fact of masking or doubling nature itself. In some sense, we might think of language as an originary mask or double for the world, and which leaves much of our human world subject to the vicissitudes of treaties and contracts and promises, but also the violation of those\u2014meaning war, a phenomenon that seems alien to even our most closely related animal kin. (One here might think of Franz Kafka's observation that the animals can be so sanguine because _they_ never left the Garden of Eden...)\n\nFrom Section 3.4:\n\n> We have great intentions for the future, until the future becomes today. Our neocortex can imagine them, but we are emotionally blind to long-term issues like climate change or energy depletion.\u00a0_Emotionally, the future isn\u2019t real._\n\nI don't buy that our brain anatomy means \"the future\" is only a conceptual imagining rather than an affective reality. Discrepancies between present descriptions of our preferred future states and those actual future states are surely more multifactored than that. Emerson's quip that \"Our moods do not believe in each other\" would be a better entry.\n\nFrom Section 3.5:\n\n> We are also primed to cooperate with our in-group whether that is a small business, large corporation, or even a nation-state - to obtain monetary (or in earlier times, physical) surplus.\n\nI agree obtaining surplus is a major purpose of many cooperative enterprises (though not all), but I wonder how much this construction has things backward: it's surplus that _causes_ human cooperation\u2014e.g., surplus of feeling/affect or even cognition, such as one finds around the anarchist concept of \"mutual aid.\" \n\nFrom Section 3.6:\n\n> Since the Neolithic, human society has organized around growth of surplus, initially measured physically e.g. grain, now measured by digital claims on physical surplus, (or money)\u00a0\n\nThe slide or sleight of hand which converts 3.5's \"monetary [...] surplus\" to the total equivocation of surplus and money\u2014needs some pressure put on it, less because I think it's wrong than because it's so suggestive it needs more unpacking (for me). On one hand, I could imagine \"money is (a proxy for) surplus\" as superficially compatible with George Gilder's definition of money as a measure or proxy for wealth; on the other hand, that superficial compatibility is broken by acknowledging that Gilder's definition of wealth is knowledge, a store of learning, and it's difficult to know what \"surplus knowledge\" would exactly mean, and whether it would bear an historically acknowledged relation to surplus grain. Though I think one possible definition of \"surplus knowledge\" in the above sense could be: philosophy or philosophizing, the over-thinking of things. <:cPES_Wink:623401321382281226> On that note, I would probably want to trace the money concept to one of the earliest human institutions, i.e., promising. Promises are \"performatives\" in the sense that they do not simply describe the world but _change_ it or _enact_ their contents. (Other performatives include the marital vow \"I do\" and the christening of ships, neither of which describe the world as it is but change or add some surplus to how the world can be described; this surplus in language that has physical weight might be called\u2014why not\u2014'libido,' a psychical energetics at some fractured remove from physical energetics.) Consequently one way to understand performatives is as testing or sounding the strength of a social field, and that is why I describe promising as among the oldest of human institutions. The money concept seems to me an outgrowth of this promissory institution of language rather than commodity exchange\u2014and I should note that for this reason I also decline 'chartalist' or State-based theories of money as overstating their case. Anyway, I don't disagree with money and surplus being linked, but I want it finer tuned. Anne Carson's _Economy of the Unlost_ explores one of the first ardent users of coinage, the poet Simonides of Keos, who charged for his verses, and which poses some surprisingly subtle problems with both commodity and chartalist theories of money.\n\n(On this point I will add that at the recent Game of Nodes session, the host kind of needled Jake on Juno's Prop 16 drama and asked why companies would build on chains where their assets can be voted away. However, the real question is: Why do they do that already, rather than taking to the high seas and declaring independence as pirates? A main reason: actually a lot of people don't like shopping with pirates. The US recently seized SBF's personal Robinhood stocks, and I think many people feel that is the correct move. The social design aspect of the crypto revolution is an essential part of its long-term promise and appeal, not something to be ashamed of or shy away from; and we shouldn't cede way to romantic but reckless (and almost always cruel) fantasies of absolute piratical sovereignty.)\n\nLil D strikes again! \u2728\u2728\u2728\n\nI read Sections 4.0-4.2 as introducing but somewhat skirting or downplaying the mystery of homeostasis. It sounds sensible and 'economic' enough to say:\n\n> Organisms utilize foraging strategies that optimize energy intake vs. energy expenditure adjusted for time and risk.\n\nbut if organisms really did merely optimize in this way, then why the hell are there so many organisms with so many varying sets of (alleged) optimization? And if bodies are optimized for homeostasis, then why do they so often fail to achieve it? Another way of putting this might be: Why bother with _any_ nonzero homeostasis? Zero intake and zero expenditure are ostensibly the easiest or most sustainable of all homeostatic equilibria. It might be the case that Life is \"miraculous\" or some kind of separate or counterforce to the inorganic; but another possibility is that the inorganic itself might not designate a zero-sum inertia... Again my point here isn't so much to suggest the claim is wrong or inaccurate as that it could benefit from deeper exfoliation.\n\nFrom Section 4.6:\n\n> _Economists view capital, labor and human creativity as primary and energy secondary or absent. The opposite is, in fact, true. We are energy blind._\n\nI appreciate the rhetorical flare. I don't know that it makes sense to relegate either of those to primary/secondary (or absent!?) roles; they seem to me equals, like trying to decide whether the firefighter who connects the hydrant or the firefighter who holds the hose are more responsible for fighting the fire. Arguing about primacy of one part over another here seems to be more politically motivated than guided by careful reasoning, since both are actually necessary for the end result. That said, I do love this provocation, not least because of the way it sets up the punch here from Section 4.7:\n\n> Technology is an expression of the available energy we can exploit (Brockway, 2013). What we call \u201ctechnological progress\u201d at any time is mostly the development of the capital base to support an ever-greater throughput of available energy at a later time.\u00a0\n\nas well as this from Section 4.9:\n\n> Organisms that require more energy to find food than the food contains, will die. We only get away with this because our institutions and policies treat the energy subsidy from fossil hydrocarbons as interest, not principal.\n\nBack to the money concept in Section 4.10:\n\n> Contrary to what is taught in economics textbooks, money is not lent out from existing wealth\u2013 it is created (Werner, 2014;\u00a0Ament, 2019). This new money eventually gets spent on a good or service which will contain\u00a0embodied energy.\u00a0Money is a claim on energy yet its creation is not tethered to energy availability or cost.\n\nHere there's again sleight of hand or too-fast analysis that joins several things together that may appear the same to us only by historical contingency rather than natural necessity. I mean in particular the confusion of the institution of money with the institution of banking, which are several if not separable institutions. The central motor of today's banking, i.e., making loans by creating deposits in accordance with fractional reserve policies, is the definition of what Nakomoto called the \"double-spend problem\"\u2014I say \"today's banking\" but it was a problem in other times and places as well, albeit the process of making and taking loans has varied widely under differing jurisdictions and monetary systems. Finally, I think that \"money is a claim on energy\" is accurate in some reductionist calculus, but it becomes less clear in cases of avarice (or what Aristotle dubbed \"incontinence\") or under wide-scale financialization, which George Gilder defines as the social condition in which money _becomes_ wealth directly, rather than money _being a measure_ of wealth. Still, I'll accept the reductionist calculus as holding good on some 'ultimate' or long-term horizon, where the creation of money runs up against energy availability.\n\nI particularly enjoyed Section 4.11:\n\n> This makes debt more accurately an \u2018intertemporal transfer of\u00a0consumption\u2019 [rather than consumption preferences].\n\nHere again there's a reductionist calculus at work, but I think it has heuristic value. The argument that debt\u2014or, the creation of money untethered from 'real' energy available or 'real' productive forces\u2014is effectively a robbery of future generations is a powerful idea that goes back to the forming of modern republics. Marquis de Sade, the namesake of sadism and an overall degenerate, turned out to write some political tracts of interest while locked away in the Bastille, including a pamphlet, \"One More Effort, Frenchmen, If You Wish To Be Republicans,\" inserted within _Philosophy in the Bedroom_, that effectively argues for the severance of money and state as the necessary final step for truly republican revolution. But of course the issue here was: sever it from state (and hence from gold), _and then what?_ No other systems or technology existed then that could fully replace gold; the printing presses were the best technology for monetary innovation at the time and the lessons of those experiments have formed what we today call 'economics.' A stumbling point I thought showed up at the end of this section here:\n\n> Thus debt can be seen as a tool humans use to access an energy gradient, and the resulting goods and services. Debt has been referred to as \u2018fake energy\u2019 (Weyler, 2011). More accurately, debt moves real energy and consumption from the future, to the present, unsustainably. But it is fake in the sense that to pay back the debt, we have to also pay back the energy. One could say this amount (and related consumption) is \u201cborrowed\u201d energy.\n\nBy the paper's own classification, there are two types of technology: Type 1 that enhances or innovates energy sources, and Type 2 that deploys energy for labor or other ends. Type 1 technology, the mere possibility of which seems to lend credence to the view of a non-zero sum inorganic/natural world, would be the way that debt 'de-frauds' itself. (Sorry for the abuse of defraud.) There's a story in some economics text I've read of an agrarian society where the people believed that if one farmer grew more yams than the other farmers, it was because that farmer had used magic to spirit the other farmers' yams away, and therefore deserved to be punished. This 'zero-sum' view of wealth and productivity is recapitulated here in terms of global energy availability rather than local soil fertility, but at the risk inviting futurism, this latter-day zero-sum view of energy availability seems to depend on ignoring any interstellar or interplanetary energy sources that may become available in the coming decades, and which may make our zero-sum punishments today seem like the punishments of yam farmers in other places.\n\nOn Section 4.12: \n\n> After basic needs are met, the best things in life are free.\n\nI'm dubious about the whole section and its use of social/psychological data, but I'm still sympathetic to the broader point that money doesn't buy happiness.\n\nFigure 8 from Section 5.0 got a chuckle out of me:\n\n\n\nI don't know what monetary/economic history was consulted for this chart (which is admitted to be \"not to scale\"), but I", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": {"channel": 1032788394893398026}, "index": 6, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "a46cc6b3-f29e-4990-8a0c-ec9c6a57c3ce", "node_info": {"start": 80453, "end": 95284}}, {"text": "fertility, but at the risk inviting futurism, this latter-day zero-sum view of energy availability seems to depend on ignoring any interstellar or interplanetary energy sources that may become available in the coming decades, and which may make our zero-sum punishments today seem like the punishments of yam farmers in other places.\n\nOn Section 4.12: \n\n> After basic needs are met, the best things in life are free.\n\nI'm dubious about the whole section and its use of social/psychological data, but I'm still sympathetic to the broader point that money doesn't buy happiness.\n\nFigure 8 from Section 5.0 got a chuckle out of me:\n\n\n\nI don't know what monetary/economic history was consulted for this chart (which is admitted to be \"not to scale\"), but I don't think that money creation and available energy were ever as correlated as all that suggests. Even focusing on the narrower band of time specified, i.e., the dawn of the Industrial Era, it's hard to find much corroboration for the claim that money creation was bound to energy availability. There's even some weird implication here that previous financial crises didn't happen or were somehow trivialized (appearing but as blips on a smooth curve) when compared to that crisis caused by the future outstripping of energy. A broader sense of monetary/economic history would possibly sharpen this argument by demonstrating financial busts/booms (and credit creation more generally) relative to energy sources and Type 1 tech availability at the time, but I suspect the results could be more mixed and raise deeper questions about the relation of energy and monetary systems. I found myself questioning the historical bona fides once again with the following claim:\n\n> These changes allowed economic growth to continue until it hit a wall with conventional finance in 2008 (Point C)\u2013 at which point central banks and global governments were forced to essentially redesign the entire financial system.\n\nI don't think that many people consider post-1970s global finance to be \"conventional finance,\" even if its surprising longevity has given it the appearance of convention. The abandonment of the gold standard and introduction of the \"currency float\" by Nixon and Friedman has meant that today currency trading and speculation make up more global financial activity than almost every other sector combined. (A point I find interesting about Friedman: he also argued that abandoning the gold standard would almost dangerously centralize power over labor value to central bankers and governments, and he consequently proposed a full UBI as a counter-weight to the corruption by printers and speculators.) Indeed, the 1970s or post-Bretton Woods monetary system became known as \"monetarism\" and distanced itself from both market 'fundamentalists' and Keynesian 'radicals', yet tended to do so in practice by adopting the worst and ignoring the best of each.\n\n> We are now heading towards Point D, where our global monetary representations of reality continue to decouple from the underlying biophysical reality (red curve).\n\nInasmuch as I would trace the money concept to the performative institution (or symbolic 'surplus' in physical reality) of promise-making, -breaking, and -keeping, I wonder whether viewing money supply in terms of \"biophysical reality\" or 'real forces of production' (as commodity theory might prefer) isn't missing or distorting something essential about the money concept, if not the 'real' reality itself.\n\nFrom Section 5.1:\n\n> Rather, we have a strong preference for positive experiences in the present moment (Hagens, 2010). Even the ecologically literate will avoid \u2018sustainable\u2019 practices that accomplish equal goals but require more time (Penn, 2019).\n\nHere finally comes another nonnegotiable force, perhaps even more difficult to massage than energy availability: time. To the position that \"money is a claim on energy\" can be opposed the more common understanding that \"money is time,\" more specifically that any healthy monetary system stores/measures the time-value and time-costs of individual and collective learning. \n\nFrom Section 5.2:\n\n> The emergent property of 7.7 billion humans going through their daily lives following simple rules like these is a \u2018Superorganism\u2019 with a 17\u00a0TW metabolism.\n\nThis and the ensuing description through 6.1 of the humanity Superorganism as made up of oil pipes and data cables and orbiting satellites put me in mind of Reza Negarastani's _Cyclonopedia_, a horror-theory novel in which the Middle East/planet becomes cursedly sentient through oil.\n\n> In principle a superorganism could be super intelligent but ours is not.\n\nBanger line, and one of the cooler features made known to us by dynamical systems research: our universe can be written (truly, a uni-verse, a poem of the Oneness of all existence) without for all that having an Author. But immediately following that is this:\n\n> \u00a0In the 1930s economists chose GDP as a metric to track economic activity, not as an end goal. Yet almost 100 years later, our economies unconsciously, relentlessly, pursue the GDP carrot, often toward frivolous endeavors that promise the greatest financial return in the shortest time.\n\nwhich again for me calls into question the overall familiarity with economic/monetary history and policy. And from here follows a long stream of Sections that I find to be of less clear relevance: is the argument that if less money that had been created, there would be less climate change? Again back to this 'ultimate' zero-sum position that sounds sensible but might be ignoring some reality.\n\nIn Section 8:\n\n> Many challenges we face appear as classic social traps, whereby short-term social pressures guide individual behavior in opposition to the best long-run interest of the individual and society (Costanza, 1987).\n\nThis \"social trap\" is sometimes called the Prisoners' Dilemma and describes any decision space where agents would achieve the best outcome for each and all by cooperating but can also achieve a meager to moderate outcome for themselves with penalties for the rest by defecting from the group effort. In short, the risk of cooperating causes the cooperation to fail. Although I would expect this paper to advocate for the side of becoming or 'living up to' a superorganism, it seems to effectively accept defeat and propose reducing the number of agents and constraining the global decision space so as to reduce our superorganism's negative externalities:\n\n> Perhaps the biggest social trap of all is that we don\u2019t actually need all this energy and material stuff to be happy or healthy.\u00a0\n\nThere's something 'off' about this line to me. What if someone's happy and healthy life _does_ require \"all this energy and material stuff\"\u2014not just, e.g., people with disabilities or chronic illnesses with actual needs, but people who genuinely feel their lives are more significant because of their access to these further realms?\n\nI see that Section 9.1 includes a call for UBI but acknowledges what Friedman had feared about unchaining the money supply from gold without UBI: that the unchecked consumption of resources by the rich would devastate the rest and basically render the UBI pointless by its implementation.\n\nSection 9.2 includes this snappy line:\n\n> Finally, just as we discovered that we live in a heliocentric world, and that we evolved, we now begin to see that we are part of a biologically emergent Superorganism which is de-facto eating the planet.\n\nthough the rest of it made me wonder about the issues (not addressed here) of AI replacing labor and the energy and productivity trade-offs.\n\nSection 10 was a let-down! A bunch of rhetorical questions do not make an argument.\n\nSo, the solution proffered here is something like: cull the Superorganism back to a manageable size and curb \"unnecessaries\" (unnecessary to whom, however?) since, apparently, they can never lead to any Type 1 technologies that would obviate the problems raised in the article.... A recurring debate in the US and perhaps elsewhere is the value of (video) gaming, whether it does anything other than allegedly incite violence; yet I suspect some number of computer scientists today got into the field as a result of wanting to make a game of their own when they were young, whether that's what they do now or not. The reduction of \"unnecessaries\" is in any case always a political question with overtones of austerity economics, and as the video game example is meant to demonstrate, reduction of supposed unnecessaries and play can have its own unpredictable and adverse consequences. \n\nAnother solution to the Superorganism/Prisoners' Dilemma was sketched out by Vitalik Buterin in \"Superrationality and DAOs,\" https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/01/23/superrationality-daos, in which he argues that the Prisoner's Dilemma can be resolved, especially at scale, if there exists a means of ascertaining the _virtue_ of other participants. This is where the DAO becomes important, because the DAO's activities are on a public blockchain and its virtue\u2014its likelihood to defect and betray the group\u2014can be assessed in unprecedented forms, thus unlocking \"superrational\" coordinations of human activity and interests.\n\nOf course Buterin's piece is speculative (it's from _2015_), so it would be useful to pair it with perusal of a more recent statement, e.g., \"DAOs Are Not Corporations,\" https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/09/20/daos.html. I would prefer to understand corporations/companies as any organized or collective action at scale, often (but not always) via financial instruments, but Buterin mostly uses the term here to refer to for-profit, executive-led, C-corp types of corporation, or what he calls the authoritarian \"stereotypical large corporations.\" This may be a semantic squabble. In any case, Buterin notes:\n\n> Many of the more recent DAOs differ from earlier DAOs, like MakerDAO, in that whereas the earlier DAOs are organized around\u00a0providing infrastructure, the newer DAOs are organized around\u00a0performing various tasks around a particular theme.\u00a0\n\nThis contains the key development in the argument: the \"virtue\" of DAOs in \"Superrationality\" now becomes the \"credible fairness\" of DAOs in the engagement of some pursuits. This is at issue because DAOs do not simply resist nation-states, but may even take over functions of nation-states: thus they need to demonstrate credibility and credible fairness at levels commensurate with those being subsumed.\n\nFor Buterin, there are three meaningful ways to achieve credibility and demonstrate it, but only one is readily available for DAOs:\n\n> There are typically three ways of dealing with these types of corruption and insider trading issues:\n> \n> \u2014 Retroactively punish\u00a0malicious deciders.\n> \u2014 Proactively\u00a0filter for higher-quality\u00a0deciders.\n> \u2014 Add\u00a0more\u00a0deciders.\n> \n> The corporate world typically focuses on the first two, using financial surveillance and judicious penalties for the first and in-person interviews and background checks for the second. The decentralized world has less access to such tools: project tokens are likely to be tradeable anonymously, DAOs have at best limited recourse to external judicial systems, and the remote and online nature of the projects and the desire for global inclusivity makes it harder to do background checks and informal in-person \"smell tests\" for character. Hence, the decentralized world needs to put more weight on the third technique: distribute decision-making power among\u00a0more\u00a0deciders, so that each individual decider has less power, and so collusions are more likely to be whistleblown on and revealed.\n\nIn contrast to the Hagens article, Buterin envisions a solution to unchecked deleterious consumption through increasing participation rather than limiting it and removing 'unnecessaries.' I incline more towards Buterin's position although I recognize some of his idealism in just assuming sufficiently broad participation, thereby sidestepping the question of how participation becomes broad in the first place. For myself, I say that decentralization (like democracy) is a regulatory or legislative ideal rather than particular achievable states; in reality we are always dealing with representative systems and delegated authority\u2014and this isn't some evil that has to be stomped out, it's part of our condition as social creatures. If each person counts as an element in a set, then each group of people is a subset, and we know by the power law that there are always more subsets than elements of a set (in fact, there are 2^n more subsets than elements of a set of n elements). To return some earlier language here: Representation, or 'the symbolic' more broadly, necessarily suffuses the lives of beings which recognize themselves as beings of beings\u2014or even recognize themselves as beings of Being, if in a philosophical mood. <:feelsOldMan:1051281090784022670>\n\nAhem, **clears throat*, having gone through all that... I understand some of what you're saying here (\"I know some of those words!\") and the two questions you raise (about oracle security and more general oracle provenance, as I understand it) are indeed those of the Superorganism/DAO problem. The Hagens Superorganism solution might be to restrict unnecessaries and focus on quality sources; the Buterin DAO solution is to multiply sources to drown out bad quality. Yet I think Hagens is still correct to point out that some things, such as energy availability, cannot be drowned out or conjured away. But I'm not convinced that \"money is energy,\" nor even \"money is time\"\u2014one formula I find more intriguing is that money is \"frozen desire,\" a more plaintive formula is that money 'measures' the informational (rather than biophysical) economy. I'm not sure that any of this helps you, or that either Hagens or Buterin offer much help for your use-case dealing with particular kinds of data and data sources, but it is always interesting to me to see how people are responding to these design challenges. Unfortunately I don't really know anything about code or programming (at the moment); most of my abilities/interactions in the space so far are constrained to providing descriptions or redescriptions of some systems and ideas in what I hope are clarifying or at least interesting terms to help others work through their own questions.

Most things in the universe aren't. And everything that is alive traces back to things that, puzzlingly, weren't.\nFor centuries, the scientific question of life's origins has confounded us. But in Every Life Is on Fire, physicist Jeremy England argues that the answer has been under our noses the whole time, deep within the laws of thermodynamics. England explains how, counterintuitively, the very same forces that tend to tear things apart assembled the first living systems.\nBut how life began isn't just a scientific question.

What follows are just preliminary notes with some general thoughts in relation to designing DAOs, which I'd normally keep to my research journal, but I thought typing them up might have some tangential interest to someone here:\n\nRavaisson argues (_pace_ and proleptically to Bergson) that habit\u2014which demands repetition, stereotypy, discipline\u2014paradoxically _suffuses the body with freedom._ I might even say habit introduces a second-order freedom: a freedom not only to perform certain actions, but to perform them _more or less well,_ i.e., to artfully or virtuously (as in: virtuoso) perform actions. (For more on virtue/virtuosity, consult Paolo Virno's essay \"Virtuosity and Revolution: The Political Theory of Exodus,\" which appears here:\u00a0https://www.generation-online.org/c/fcmultitude2.html\u00a0but has also been slightly updated/revised for his recent collection _The Idea of World_.)\n\nOne of the major insights of psychoanalysis\u2014which, as Deleuze correctly notes, refers to habit/homeostasis as \"pleasure principle\"\u2014is that in the living/organic being, or at least in human beings, there is some motor \"beyond the pleasure principle\" (i.e. beyond habit), something which (as Lacan will later explain) shears or splits pleasure from satisfaction, such that humans are capable of finding satisfaction in their own misery and unpleasure.\u00a0\n\nFreud somewhat controversially calls this motor \"the death drive,\" but it is actually a profoundly creative force as well: it makes possible human engagement beyond the limits of 'economic sense,' fomenting our work in arts, sciences, politics, and beyond. So the point is not about eliminating this \"death drive,\" which would paradoxically drain human reality of its life. But there is no denying that people often show up in analysis precisely when they (or, sometimes, their friends or family) have recognized this miserable satisfaction as counter to their flourishing.\u00a0\n\nOne job of analysis is therefore to put the harness of desire back on unruly satisfaction. It is only by targeting this deeper motor (i.e., death drive) that one has a chance of meaningfully changing (or changing one's second-order relation to) one's habits\u2014hence not only of what actions one performs, but of performing one's existing repertoire of actions more or less \"well,\" i.e., more or less in conformity with one's desire. At the same time, the death drive also means that all habit and all pleasure is split from within, and thus that living bodies will never be able to cultivate perfect habits, and living bodies themselves will never be perfectible.\u00a0\n\nHuman reality, our life in common, is therefore split, riven between (i) our use of words which say more and less than we mean, and (ii) the umbral tide of satisfactions which we do not want. (The 'living our' or embodiment of this split might be a candidate description for human sexuality.)\n\nWhat has any of this to do with designing DAOs? If a system is supposed to be decentralized and public, then it should take care to observe human nature so as not to pointlessly repress behaviors but to cultivate the interface between system and members.\n\nSome have argued\u2014such as Vitalik Buterin\u2014that mere transparency or publicity are sufficient to overcome the 'corrupting' or colluding forces that can arise in an organization, cf:\n\n> Hence, the decentralized world needs to put more weight on the third technique: distribute decision-making power among\u00a0more\u00a0deciders, so that each individual decider has less power, and so collusions are more likely to be whistleblown on and revealed. (\"DAOs are not corporations,\"\u00a0https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/09/20/daos.html)\n\nThis is consistent with Buterin's overall position on lying and deception, which draws from machine learning research to make claims about human cognition\u2014to wit, Buterin says that it is hard to 'fake' your position or consciously lie to others, on the basis that two processes happening concurrently on a PC makes the PC slower and more error-prone: _mutatis mutandi_ for humans running two competing computational or emotional processes (greed inside, virtuous altruism outside).\n\nIt's legitimate to want to question and put pressure on the use of machine learning results to frame human cognition, but for a psychoanalytically informed view of human being, there's something quite right about Buterin's formulation, if not the final destination or peregrinations of the intervening argument: Freud himself specifies that human cognition is marked or split by two parallel and coeval processes, which he called Primary (the unconscious) and Secondary (consciousness). Freud noted, as Buterin does, that these parallel processes indeed give rise to quite wild varieties of error and inefficiency\u00a0in human reality and human institutions.\n\nAnother source of pressure on Buterin's democratic ideals comes directly from anti-democratic republicans (I'm not referring to the US GOP/DNC political parties) who variously portray the public as a noisy, mad, unwashed, uneducated, irrational, emotional, possibly communist (or otherwise revolutionary) \"mob.\" I note in passing that these adjectives were\u2014and still are\u2014often applied to those in suffrage and freedom movements. An especially zesty anti-democrat might throw down a gauntlet such as: Should the nuclear reactors be staffed by public election, or even via chance appointment of public members?\u00a0Here one might wish to object that technology operations and political decision-making are separate realms, but that response begs the question, especially in light of today's scandals over large social media/technology organization's content moderation policies and the impact on political processes. Something deeper is therefore needed.\n\nWhat a psychoanalytic understanding of human being can provide is a corrective against both republican and democratic tendencies to exaggerate and romanticize human nature, either that of experts or the common person.\n\nIn the first place, I will note as I often do that democracy is what philosophers would call a regulatory or legislative ideal\u2014some argue the ultimate democracy, or equality of all in death, is the very ground of politics as such, the fatal calculus to which one recurs in deciding whether to obey or rebel (\"Give me liberty or give me death!\")\u2014and not a specifically realizable state or political form.\u00a0\n\nWhat would \"democracy\" look like, anyway? It is known that the political body in Attic democracy was not formed by public elections but by a \"drawing of lots\" (essentially, by raffle or a dice toss), combined with remarkably short terms of service from six to twelve months. Is this _more or less_ democratic than the systems of many elected parliamentary democracies today? The fact that democracies can only ever be described as _more or less_ democratic indicates that the formation of a political democracy is always a \"second-order\" action, one that in some sense always re-performs the ultimate democracy[1] of politics as such.\n\n|| > 1. But is \"the ultimate democracy\" really that of Death? This was Hegel's position: the Master-Slave or Lord-Bondsman dialectic only gives way at the brink of death, when one pulls back and each \"recognize\" the authority or submission of the other. This combat-oriented vision of dialectic (and politics in general) may however be rather partial or inadequate, since there are many claims for recognition which are not concluded by violent struggle, not even by proxy or 'at the limit,' as might be said. That is to say, there very much exist life-and-death consequences to many political struggles, but it is clearly not the case that all such struggles are terminated by life-or-death ultimatums, even by proxy or 'at the limit' (whatever that would mean). Perhaps there is therefore another 'ultimate democracy' to which humans appeal. (Even better in my opinion, more accurate to say: democracy ruins the ultimate, by 'imaging' the ultimate itself.)

Perhaps there is therefore another 'ultimate democracy' to which humans appeal. (Even better in my opinion, more accurate to say: democracy ruins the ultimate, by 'imaging' the ultimate itself.) Jacques Ranci\u00e8re has argued that this democracy is the democracy of the Intelligence: any meaningfully known or understood concept, no matter how rarefied or abstruse its content, must still be graspable by others. Indeed, before the \"equality of death\" which apparently governs the dialectical process of history, there must be some \"equality of understandings\" of the meaning of recognition, otherwise the struggle to death would always and everywhere prevail. Let us put it this way: Democracy as a political form or ideal appears to us as always-already _re-performed_, _encore_ (and _en corps_), first as Death, then as Intelligence. ||\n\nWhen humans bind themselves together in an organization of any sort\u2014that is, when they form a new image of life together\u2014they create or introduce into the world a second-order to their actions: now they not only perform this or that action, but they perform actions more or less well, that is, more or less in accord with their organization's image of life in common.\n\nEmerson's proviso in the epigraph to these notes can be taken as a corrective to the twin tendencies/temptations of democrats and republicans (again, not the US parties) with respect to democracy. That is, the democratic exaggeration might see in democracy a direct \"doubling\" of the lives of the political community, hence entirely absolving the need for representative structures, whereas the republican exaggeration sees in democracy inefficient and incompetent \"divisions\" of life and power.\n\nWhat I'm calling a psychoanalytic understanding of human being or human nature helps to check these tendencies and orient our political thinking along lines that cultivate flourishing over punishing waywardness, where possible, by furnishing an \"image of life\" that captures or corresponds to what is \"living\" in human life, i.e., desire.\n\nTo the republican nightmare of unruly mobs, psychoanalysis attests to the following fact: _every person thinks,_ every person is thinking about their lives. But even among groups of experts, there exists an opacity of consciousness to itself\u2014Freud called it the unconscious, but I've presented it above in terms of the splitting of pleasure and satisfaction, habit (homeostasis) and death drive. This fundamental opacity means that even groups of trained experts are susceptible to groupthink and 'corruption,' even in the absence of incentives or coercive measures for such.\n\nThis has to do with the \"scaling\" of human organizations. This scaling is never additive but multiplicative, and this multiplication can be (and probably often is) fractional, rarely a whole number. This is why we often find in democratic organizations (or in organizations that optimize for member\u00a0governance: \"of the people, by the people, for the people\") \"fractalized\" patterns of governance and control. (For more on this, check out Benoit Mandelbrot's _The Misbehavior of Markets_, which lays out many of his important insights on human organizations as fractional or fractal systems.)\u00a0Perhaps this is most evident in the experiment of the United States, with its national legislature, state legislatures, etc., followed by federal courts, state courts, etc., followed by national executive, state executives, etc. This \"nesting\" or fractalized system of governance may only be weakly to moderately ergodic\u2014this is often cited in the republicans' complaints: democracies have too much disorder, discord, and dissensus among their levels to govern effectively and decisively\u2014but the non-ergodicity of these structures may in fact be their most salient political value, since this is what guarantees their functional oversight of each other and the capacity to evolve in relation to a community.\n\nTo the democratic dream of total participation or perfect representation (which coincides with non-representation), psychoanalysis provides the following reminder: _every person enjoys,_ and enjoyment (or satisfaction) disturbs the habits of body and mind you wish to perfect. Here a deeper detour into psychoanalysis can be instructive (see also Slavoj Zizek\u2019s _For They Know Not What They Do: Enjoyment as a Political Factor_). Where, after all, does enjoyment (either as opposed to pleasure, or as surplus-pleasure) come from? It comes from the 'symbolic' operations in infantile life: not only does milk satisfy the infant's hunger, but a symbolic excess attaches to the act of feeding, such that, e.g., the suckling action at the bottle or breast, the way you're held, or the sounds in the background can all become obscure points of fixation and surplus-pleasure or enjoyment. The infant is induced into symbolic operations because of our species' premature birth and chronic neoteny, or what Freud calls the \"radical helplessness\" (_Hilflosigkeit_) of the human being, our dependence on a parent/neighbor/helper.\u00a0\n\nThis disturbance of\u00a0surplus-pleasure mandates a quota of representational or symbolic operation because the infant cannot contain or \"bind\" all of its pleasure in physical processes. Thus commences the child's slow crawl toward the acquisition of language, the negation-fueled fantasies of puberty, and the allegedly \"adult\" world of reason. When humans come together in an organization, they are still individually guided by the contingencies in their development.\n\nHere comes finally my big idea or proposition:\u00a0DAOs\u2014successful public DAOs, anyway, like other successful public institutions\u2014must be able to achieve or facilitate something like a 'psychoanalysis' of their members, in order for those members to evaluate their actions in terms of the organization's image of a common life.\n\nIn many cases, especially where organizational membership is voluntary and the scope of activities is somewhat restricted, this process is often already done (if imperfectly) by society: one's enjoyments already attune one to \"becoming,\" say, a mathematician or Democrat.\n\nBut for DAOs that cannot readily count on members who've been similarly socialized and/or for DAOs with scopes of action that may be large, variable, or cross multiple specializations, how they on-board new members and facilitate adoption will be of some consequence, especially when decisions are made by vote.\n\nOne solution for DAOs may be to set up a \"bootcamp\" or \"orientation\" process for new members. The wisdom of this solution is ancient; Machiavelli would take it for granted that one can convert the ethical habits of individuals into the broader \u00a0_customs_ of a society, which themselves, when sufficiently coherent and organized, can become a _state._\n\nThe purpose of linking DAOs to psychoanalysis is that DAOs, like analysis, can powerfully disrupt and reconfigure the transitions between habits, customs, and states\u2014they are capable of reaching \"beyond the pleasure principle,\" that is, beyond the sickly homeostasis of financialization.\u00a0\n\nYet DAOs can only do this by being mindful of their representational excesses (i.e., their representative/organizational structure), and especially of being mindful of the uneven representational excesses that a decentralized membership\u00a0brings with it. Developing ways for DAOs to operate _through_ the ambiguity of differences of opinion and contradictory priorities\u2014put differently: for DAOs to _listen_ to their members, even when members barely speak the same language or are of patently different socializations\u2014through thoughtful governance designs, uniquely possible on blockchain, will be crucial to DAOs' survival as public institutions and will determine how DAOs challenge existing public institutions to reform. That is, if DAOs (and crypto more generally) introduce new digital freedoms to the (physical or political) body, many of which are still barely understood and little articulated, they will have to possess some means of addressing the unruly motor of human motivation to properly \"suffuse\" this freedom throughout the body. This is why novel or refined voting systems and governance/decision-making processes are key to the DAO concept, if not its hallmarks.\n\nthis is a cool point. i think <@753720709032968213> has shared before papers about designing systems explicitly for conflict that i am reminded of from this\n\nAlso in connection to this point is the historian of science Georges Canguilhem's argument that the \"health\" of an organism is not its fixity to a norm, as though sickness were the fall from or a lack of a norm\u2014in fact, sicknesses very often establish their own homeostatic equilibrium. Canguilhem thus says that the health of an organism should be defined as its capacity to establish new norms, rather than its adherence to one.\n\nOne point I plan to develop further: what is the relation between organ, organism, and organization? How does life enter or filter out of these entities? To read on this front: Pierre Klossowski's _Living Currency_ and Michael Marder's _Hegel's Energy_, both somewhat philosophical takes on biological or libidinal energetics and social economics.\n\nAlston has written about \"governance through conflict\": https://law.mit.edu/pub/governanceasconflict/release/1\n\nThere's something about the definition of \"shared values\" as the ground of an organization or group that sticks out to me as needing some (or maybe a lot of) scrutiny, but it doesn't make much difference within Alston's argument at large. \n\nBut in response to the claim that \"sufficiently shared values lead to a common purpose that constitutes an organization,\" I would say that values are rarely the sole or main criteria for membership in a group/organization. Moreover, a common purpose can be defined independently of shared values, although shared values may indeed contribute greatly to the legitimacy and long-term acceptance of this purpose. In fact, the common purpose can determine the shared values, rather than the reverse. For example I think it would be difficult to determine the \"shared values\" of a citizenry in a way that would be prior to or constitutive of their purpose (survival).\n\nBeing able to define and use shared values to navigate conflict is a powerful governance tool\u2014hence the importance of an organization's Constitutional design\u2014but there may still be an outstanding question of how to navigate _conflicting values_ under a shared purpose. Or this may just be terminological, I haven't decided.\n\nThinking a little more about it... Alston might say navigation of a conflict of values would need to be channeled through an organization's/constitution's amendment process. <a:hmmPizza:1050825992609988609>\n\nOnce again I am going to have Eric read these thoughts. He\u2019s going to be thrilled! I\u2019m at a conf with him this weekend in Berkeley.\n\nDo you perchance know if he works with DAOs only on commission? At NetaDAO we're nearing the end of our Operating Agreement/Constitution deliberations, though I still need to write up the subDAO articles and some other important odds and ends. We'll be looking for external reviewers and very probably an attorney to go over the details (attorney can add all the whatever legal verbiage).\n\nI can ask!\n\nre: \"shared values\" as the ground of an organization, Ranci\u00e8re says: \"One could say that the existence of politics is always conflictual, and never based on anything like consensual organization or delegation. We live under regimes that purport to be regimes of consensual delegation, but in reality what we call 'politics' is a conflict between two antagonistic principles\" (_Politics and Aesthetics_, 28). So the limit of shared values as an organizational ground might be those organizations that are 'political' (political _rather than what?_ perhaps rather than for-profit?).\n\nhttps://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rubin-Democracy.pdf\n\n\"A Theory of Democracy for the Administrative State\" by Edward Rubin (wip) -- some very interesting overall thoughts and historical interventions on organizational life and governance... has some nice tie-ins with Rubin's book _State, Soul, and Society_ that looks at how modern states developed alongside a modern ethos of self-fulfillment and individual liberty (today somewhat discredited or otherwise distanced by 'postmodern' emphases on pastiche and copying, irony and anxiety, etc.).\n\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/2095101 \n\nthis is a classic paper that argues \"institutional isomorphism\" (institutiones that look like each other) find it easier to interact.\n\ni've argued that DAO DAO makes it easier to confederate (https://www.else.how/p/mondragon-lessons-for-dao-dao). this paper gives me some better language to talk about this thesis. \"the iron cage revisited\" talks about isomorphism inside the organization - DAO DAO is about isomorphism at the organization's *edges* - purchase orders, payroll, and other things that have no trans-institutional representation today are given trans-institutional representation on-chain by DAO DAO and the primitives it picks. \n\noverall, this paper gives me hope that a bit of DAO DAO adoption can start a 'flywheel' - organizations that use DAO DAO will find it easier to work with other organizations that use DAO DAO.\n\noooo\n\nThanks for sharing this! I wonder if institutional isomorphism is related to what I think of as the inevitability of organizational fractalization.\u00a0Benoit Mandelbrot would ask: Why do rivers look like tree branches, and the veins of tree leaves look like rivers? But we can just as well ask: Why do governments have 'national' or top-level forms that tend to be replicated (in structure or form, though typically not in scope or purpose) downward\u2014presidents, governors, mayors... Supreme Court, circuit court, state court, county court, city court... and so on?\n\nPerhaps any organization of \"power,\" be it biological, social, militaristic, economic, etc., tends to roughly recapitulate itself beyond a certain scale.

(Leo Bersani:\u00a0\"We exist, in both time and space, in a vast network of *near-sameness,* a network characterized by relations of inaccurate replication. Accurate replication\u2014the perfect identity of terms\u2014is an attempted human correction of these correspondences, a fantasy of specularity in the place of correspondence.\")\n\nI will note: the term \"isomorphism\" here surprised me, since my academic work began in mathematics and I still reserve \"isomorphism\" for one-to-one structure-preserving maps/functions; the use here is\u00a0\n\n> a constraining process that forces one unit in population to resemble other units that face the same set of environmental conditions.\n\nTherefore I think another potential candidate for describing or contextualizing this process of inaccurate replication, given the emphasis on organizations responding to their \"environment,\" could be Darwinian \"selection\"[1]\u2014tho I want to shy away from unqualified/naive analogies between the organic and the organizational. For me, this space \"between\" the organic and the organizational corresponds to the space \"between\" the physical and the symbolic, the natural and the cultural: the point is not to permanently segregate them, nor to proclaim them as all and one, but to grapple with their emulsive immiscibilities.\n\nYou write:\u00a0\"DAO DAO is about isomorphism at the organization's edges - purchase orders, payroll, and other things that have no trans-institutional representation today are given trans-institutional representation on-chain by DAO DAO and the primitives it picks.\"\n\nThis seems to me a way of saying that DaoDao unlocks new 'environmental' possibilities for institutional/organizational life, new centers and peripheries of power and resistance, new schemes for representational techniques. It may be as hard for us to forecast the development and uses of these representational powers as it would have been for the first speakers of language to predict Marcel Proust, but I think you are eminently correct that DaoDao is capable of starting a \"flywheel\" of organizational usage, adoption, and change.\n\nIn 2015, Buterin speculated that DAOs will facilitate the formation of \"superrational\" organisms/organizations that, via their public ledgers, will replace credentialized systems of trust and punishment with measurable \"virtue\" and enticements to further virtuous/virtuoso performances. Whether this was overly optimistic or naive, the possibility to use blockchain to reform the life of institutions is closer today than ever before thanks to the work of DaoDao and its contributors, and it's why I'm glad to have NetaDAO as a place to really experiment with the idea of a public institution for the Interchain. <a:dance:1035704193891188836>\n\n1. To be sure, even within Darwinian theory, there are those who completely neglect that his theory of \"selection\" is internally split, i.e., between natural and sexual selection. Sexual selection produces 'apparently' unnecessary and even counter-to-survival results\u2014think of the peacock's feathers\u2014without which however survival would risk becoming flat and meaningless, or anyway much less libidinally satisfying. One could approach this from Hegel's observation that the rational concept of \"bird\" necessitates only one kind, whereas reality abounds with birds upon birds\u2014thus something in natural\u00a0being, or life, manifestly distorts and/or fails to correspond to the logic of rational/economic efficacy, or mere survival.\u00a0\n\nThis variety and multiplicity of the natural, or life, suppurates\u00a0the sameness of rationality. No doubt this fact was at the base of the ancient intuition held by Heraklitus and others that \"Nature encrypts itself,\" or more literally: nature\u00a0_loves_ encryption, nature loves to hide. With some libations, or in an especially speculative mood, I might claim that what nature fundamentally encrypts is the social itself, i.e., the social life of plants and animals and the deep mysteries of speciation.\n\nThe real mystery of organizational life might lie in how shared purpose nevertheless accommodates and gives rise to discrepant values. I think of such organizations as the school, where teachers are in principle all committed to providing the best education for students, yet can have various and even opposed values on how that's best achieved. Navigating the discrepancy or conflict of values is really the core of governance in these cases, and I think I would be more persuaded that organizations _invent and compel_ shared values in response to crises, rather than drawing upon them, and that the possibilities of scope and scale for this creative and coercive action is determinative of organizational life.\n\nThis would correspond to Jean-Luc Nancy's argument in _The Truth of Democracy_ (https://www.oddweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Nancy-The-Truth-of-Democracy.pdf) that the true \"common\" is not a blanket under which \"we all\" shelter\u2014some property we all hold in common\u2014but _a blank_ which stubbornly eludes us and which we all must ultimately fill in for ourselves.\n\nhttps://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003331780-4/law-unto-peter-hallward\n\n> As its usage in compounds like automation and autocracy also suggests, the \u2018auto\u2019 or \u2018self\u2019 of autonomy is ambiguous, and helps to mark the concept off from related notions of freedom and independence. What kind of actor can freely lay down a law for itself, a law in the strict, universal and commanding sense of the term? Who is the self of self-legislation? Without wanting to delve too deeply into the canonical history of European philosophy here, I think Kant\u2019s famous and uncompromising answer to this question helpfully foregrounds its conscious and voluntarist dimensions, but it unhelpfully abstracts the moral actor from all constitutive social relations, investing it in pure practical reason. Hegel\u2019s rejoinder to Kant certainly recovers the relational and plural quality of a political actor, but also diminishes its capacity to act, and to legislate, by dispersing it across the general spirit that both animates a legitimate state and \u2018disposes\u2019 its members in a law-abiding hierarchy. Rousseau\u2019s emphasis on popular sovereignty and participatory law-making, by contrast, helps clarify what\u2019s at stake in the ongoing struggle for autonomy, a struggle understood as an essentially collective effort that pits a mass community of equals against any kind of domineering elite.\n\n\n\n<:pog:1034269207594020864>\n\nEnjoying this so far. I would say that they present \"institutional analysis\" in the same way I was thinking that DAOs could psychoanalyze the social, i.e., by revealing their latent or 'unconscious' mechanisms of action: \"The problem with this way of looking at the issue of rural land conflicts in Brazil [i.e., as a deficit of revolutionary political will] is that it focuses on the upfront manifestations of the actions of players, but does not consider the institutional foundations that determine the players' incentives and constraints\" (5). \n\nAlston et al eschew non-institutional analyses for getting caught up in symptoms of social disorder and ignoring their common cause, e.g., in Brazil, the federal branch is empowered to redistribute land to the landless, but the judiciary's scope is simply to enforce legislation (property right)\u2014so the endless conflict over land comes from the authorization of two public institutions of authority whose relations are not 'properly' or fully delineated. Now some might read that inconsistency as cynical gamesmanship, \"the conspiracy of capitalists\" as it were, but this hardly explains why other countries that are even more capitalistic are not also plunged into perpetual broad-scale land disputes.\n\nhttps://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/06/when-new-york-city-really-was-run-from-a-smoke-filled-room.html\n\nHi from New York!

We also have finite state machines, which are discrete. Crucially, these two interact. Consider: flying a plain and an astroid approaches (continuous); the plane's computer needs to adjust suddenly (discretized). Making matters even more complicated, agents compete within these systems (Consider: an attacker is *trying* to crash the plane). GDS sweeps all of these concerns, *and their interactions*, into a single theoretical framework. Equilibria are their main tool. In GDS, a \"globally asymptotic state equilibrium\" means a tendancy to not fuck up, even when crazy shit happens.\n\n<@753720709032968213> mentioned some of Zargham's work at our last meet up, and i've been talking to him about non-DAO stuff and stumbled upon this paper.\n\n<@676640406875930644> i *highly* recommend this paper to you specifically. there are clear applications to security analysis.\n\nYESSS one of my favorites\n\nI have these all printed out and in my backpack right now.\n\nrelated - why traditional engineering is not so safe: https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/2908/chapter/78964/Questioning-the-Foundations-of-Traditional-Safety\n\nmy math is a little rough, does anyone know the english translation of something like\n\nperhap <@753720709032968213> ?\n\nis this like saying \"f is a function that maps any two possible states and admissible inputs (edit: given `x` which is the input that tick) to the next state?\"\n\nso i guess it would follow that `Image(f)` is the set of all possible next states, given the current state and admissible inputs\n\nthis is so fucking cool\n\nalso, i'm not sure i understand what the \"converging to\" part of this definition is doing\n\nYES YOU ARE CORRECT\n\nyes\n\nnice video lecture about this stuff: https://youtu.be/vid78CU-gsE\n\ni really like the description of \"Event Sequence time\" here\n\nYes!\n\nI am at Zargham's house now in Albany!\n\nI feel like when you read it outloud or just write it out it helps a lot!\n\n\n\nBlockscience house!

The \"big X\" is the \"statespace\" and the `Ux` is what we can call the admissible inputs -- if you think of those inputs as \"actions\" its like saying these `Ux` is all the actions that are possible (or allowed to be taken) when the current state of the system is `x`. In this notation `x'` is the new point that you land in if you were at `x` then the admissible action `u` was taken.\n\nthis is a pretty abstract construction but one implementation is calling a method on a smart contract.  `X` is the data structure in the smart contract and `x` is the current value of that struct. Given the current value there are many possible valid transactions `Ux`,  and we choose exactly one of them `u` when you execute that transaction -- then afterward the smart contract struct is in state `x'`\n\n<@676640406875930644> if you're around for chat - anytime\n\n<@755585146140491956> <@676640406875930644> when free for zargham call?\n\nlike -- sunday or monday anytime\n\nSunday (tomorrow) would work great for me!\n\nalso, sent an email asking for part II\n\nso now we wait with crossed fingers\n\nYAY\n\nUHHH hahaha Z says \"we're getting together at oxford (November) to write part II!:\"\n\naha monday also works great :)\n\nor tuesday\n\ni'm just going to remain on vacation until i feel like i've learned this stuff\n\nso >= wednesday also works :)\n\nYAY\n\nokay - free tomorrow and also now lol\n\nthink i want to figure out the crosswalk example before we try one ourselves\n\nstill working through part III of the videos\n\nso ideally after that\n\ni.e. tomorrow :)\n\nyay perfect tomorow let me know when, lololol\n\nThrilled you're into this\n\nQUITE\n\nvery glad you and nick introduced me!\n\nstill not sure if it will work for us, but WAY more promising than any other formal verification technique for these things than I have seen before\n\nYAY yes yes\n\nright?

I think we (DAO DAO) find ourselves asking similar questions to the ones that probably motivated this work - how can we run a business that operates a lot like SaaS without extracting rent from our customers? How can we come up with some objective function to maximize, but whose maximization should not become socially or ecologically deleterious?\n\nQuestions I asked: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12KAzuwEtN1NkRQZC1sRJJdbA684ytE3ggXAVdZdrLT8/edit\n\nDoing this now!

I think there are a lot of learnings we can apply to our own systems\n\n<@898769611200274482> Can I use this for the episode NOTES!??!!?

Getting better at this!\n\nquick recap of meeting with <@451859116961300501> : we're going to proceed with installing the telescope bot in our server, unless anyone has any issues with this (but from previous discussions, people have seemed to support it.) The way you interact with the bot is by emoji-tagging certain posts that you believe should be flagged for ethnographic research, but we need to be intentional about what kinds of posts we want to tell everyone to tag (what questions are we trying to ask about our governance? what are we trying to discover?). We can discuss this more in the upcoming community call.\n\nno worries!\n\nDAOchem: DAOchem is a mixture of on- and off-chain governance data sources which react to produce a holistic view of DAO governance produced by Lucia Korpas with an ETH Denver hackathon team (Sage Shelton, Son Nguyen, and stryker). We are working to integrate data on smart contract parameters, voting activity, Twitter activity, and contributor sentiment to help DAO creators, contributors and researchers understand the governance landscape\nhttps://daogovdata.info/\n\nAn overarching question driving our work is: are DAOs \"working\" right now? Are they what they say they are? Are they achieving their stated goals? How do DAO contributors feel about their experiences? To answer these questions, we're less interested in the nitty-gritty operational details specific to each DAO and more in patterns of governance structures and behaviors that might be observed across DAOs. In particular:\n\nWhat governance systems are DAO founders choosing to implement, with what \"laws\"?\nIn what (measurable) ways are DAO members participating in governance? Does DAO member activity relate to the chosen systems?\nHow satisfied are DAO members with their own experiences and with the health/success of the DAO overall? How do these experiences relate to the chosen systems?\n\nHi, I'll try to answer this for NetaDAO since it's 'sort of' my wing, but I leave this all open for other NetaDAO members to add to/correct me on.\n\n1. Are DAOs \"working\" right now?\nWe are working and right now we are forming a legal entity for the DAO since the DAO is engaged in partnerships of selling NFTs, which will involve the DAO in tax events that need clear jurisdiction. We hope to have the LLC established by January.\n\n2. Are DAOs what they say they are?\nI can't speak for others, but imo, NetaDAO is a true DAO: the people building around NETA are from all over the world and united by NETA drop. Nobody has centrally organized or planned growth or membership, and we don't want to do so going forward. NetaDAO should remain a proto-DAO, grassroots and bottom-up.  \n\n3. What governance systems are DAO founders choosing to implement, with what \"laws\"?\nDue to regulatory concerns, we are considering a \"law\" that members cannot have more than 10% control of NetaDAO's voting power, with a contract(?) that automatically limits members' stake if they exceed the cap. (This doesn't solve a sybil attack, but it solves the regulatory concern for now). Perhaps the other major \"law\" of NetaDAO is that, as a nonprofit, it will not distribute revenue to stakers. (We are researching setting up a for-profit entity that might have this capability, but time will tell.)\n\nIn thinking about NetaDAO's organizational structure, I have been looking to hybridize traditional business, university, and political party structures that are relevant, with an eye (as mentioned) toward respecting growth and enabling members to get involved. Right now we have drafted a handful of Verticals with subDAOs under each, and the subDAOs are comprised of (at least) tech leads, support, and advisory/public oversight roles (i.e., nontechnical but interested members from NetaDAO community).\n\n4. In what (measurable) ways are DAO members participating in governance? Does DAO member activity relate to the chosen system?\nNobody has put up a spam proposal so far, so I think our proposal deposit is at least high enough. We will have our first real governance activity when we try to ratify the NetaDAO Operating Agreement.\n\n5. How satisfied are DAO members with their own experiences and with the health/success of the DAO overall? How do these experiences relate to the chosen systems?\nI don't have any data on this one, but I hope (and believe) that members who have attended the weekly meetings have felt welcomed and able to contribute. I know that two people have volunteered to work on business/tax/legal issues with me, and I believe that there is a general interest to get involved in a DAO really trying to experiment and explore what a DAO can be and do.\n\nWow! Thank you for this!\n\n<@753720709032968213> / <@755585146140491956> / <@477634436586799104> / whoever else was interested in the telescope bot stuff, maybe we can just follow up in our next chat with Ellie (she wanted to have a call with us after we set up the bot)\n\nso next step is to just set up the bot, which I can do\n\nhttps://medium.com/metagov/introduction-documentation-of-the-telescope-bot-cfd084beba87\n\nHooray!\n\nhttps://medium.com/sourcecred/introduction-to-sourcecred-7665297af715\n\nCheck out this article on Sourcred \"SourceCred is an open-source technology for organizing communities.\"\n\n\"A core issue here is that fairly tracking contributions is hard. In a group of five or six people, it\u2019s easy to remember who did what, and to recognize them accordingly. But in a team of fifty or sixty, it\u2019s really hard to know about all the different kinds of value that people contributed.\"\n\nsourcecred is rly interesting\n\nAlso: here's a spreadsheet of DAOs https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16IDgIyPcfwJGG-zmXeMAenYbePQVHkc2P6WCwKEZgpk/edit#gid=0\n\nJust reading a lot of Kelsie Nabben's writings on DAOs right now and getting some interesting links out of them!\n\nhttps://kelsienabben.substack.com/p/experiments-in-algorithmic-governance?s=w\n\nExperiments in algorithmic governance continue\nTrying not to fail at Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\n\n\n\nDAO governance: Technical on-chain and social off-chain\n\nScholars have referred to two main types of DAOs as participatory and algorithmic. Participatory DAOs are managed by distributed consensus through smart contracts to signal the preferences of members. Algorithmic DAOs aim to be entirely algorithmically governed, with the underlying smart contracts dictating the entire functionality of a DAO.\n\nAn example of a participatory DAO might be GitcoinDAO, which has a council of governors, which can allocate governance tokens to stewards, deliberates proposals on forums, votes on \u201cSnapshot\u201d (an \u201coff-chain\u201d voting tool), and then executed voted proposals, such as allocating funds. An example of an algorithmic DAO is DxDAO, which launched with no pre-defined members, and is completely community run without any intervention of a project or team, which controls a decentralised trading protocol and other DeFi tools. The aim of DxDAO, as well as other DAOs which may define themselves as \u201calgorithmic\u201d, is to be \u201cas widely distributed as possible from day one\u201d.\n\nYet, all DAOs are both participatory and algorithmic. This is what is unique about DAOs. DAOs require participation, which is a political process where the actors involved in decision-making processes are positioned towards each other through power relationships that occurs \u201coff-chain\u201d, and algorithmic governance, which is the point at which decisions are reflected and executed \u201con-chain\u201d through the use of smart contracts.\n\nDefining resilience in DAOs\n\n\u201cActs in a decentralized decision-making system will be denoted resilient if it ensures all decisions made in the DAO to agree with its approximate opinion\u201d\n\nWithout a stated purpose, and engaged participants, measures for resilience and \u2018success\u2019 are unclear. Thus, a resilient is one that acts in line with its own mission and governance purpose.\n\nI am filling out this telescope bot consent form on behalf of DAO DAO, given we have gathered consent at last week's community call\n\n\n\nhey <@755585146140491956> just checking, all of our discord channels are visible to the public right? it's just that posting to certain channels are role-gated?\n\n(wondering because the telescope bot instructions say that the channel where the tagged messages appear should be public)\n\ngood q. all channels are visible except contributor-hub, which requires the DF-given contributor tag. the rest are public as long as you select the relevant react emoji in <#1037837947002703902>\n\nthis is all up for ongoing discussion\n\nhmm okay\n\nwell I didn't want telescope to violate the visibility of hidden channels\n\nI can also see the reasoning for making contributor-hub hidden to non-contributors\n\nat the same time, I think the bot should be able to include messages from contributor hub channels as those could be valuable -- so I will ask them if it is possible to make the bot post on a contributor-gated channel\n\nok, the telescope bot has been set up!\n\nthe flow works like this: tag messages you want to curate with the telescope emoji (\ud83d\udd2d) and it will appear in a special channel on the researchers' discord to be approved for curation. once they approve it, the bot DMs the author of the message to get consent. once the author approves the curation, the message will show up in the contributor hub <#1041816219403178124> channel. (side note: the bot has contributor perms and only contributors can see the telescope-bridge channel.)\n\nnow gonna reach out to ellie to see if we can schedule a meeting this week to talk about how to think about this research and message tagging!\n\nawesome!\n\ndo you have any guidelines / thoughts about what sorts of messages we should be tagging like this?\n\nanswering that question will be the goal of our call with Ellie!\n\naha you are one step ahead\n\n<@753720709032968213> <@755585146140491956> <@181607258512162816> <@676640406875930644> (and anyone else who wants to join) does Thursday 3pm PT or 4pm PT work for you to call with Ellie?\n\nboth work for me :)\n\nSend invite!\n\ncreated an event for thursday at 3pm PT! zoom link is in the description\n\nhere is the invite link to the metaeth discord!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/9hCWcBf9\n\nyou'll see a \"dao dao\" section in there. messages which have been curated will pop up, and we can click \"request\"\n\n(the \"request\" then sends a DM to the message author to consent, then finally the message will show up in telescope-bridge)\n\nreminder that the chat with Ellie is today at 3 PT! zoom link in event description\n\nhttps://www.crowdwrite.xyz/metagov/cl7e9sjvc000q09jx9kjhbocz/text\n\n<@898769611200274482> in about an hour, yes?\n\nfor the gov experience event?

Data Driven Economic Systems\nCryptoeconomic systems provide near real-time data of on-chain economic activities, and may govern access\nrights or provide proofs related to data stored off-chain. The advancement in machine learning and system identification methods over the past decade has increased our capacity for creating novel, useful models in across a wide\nrange of applications [Jordan and Mitchell 2015], and in the context of economics [Mullainathan and Spiess 2017]\nin particular. This, for the first time, allows for almost real time steering of these economies and a level of applied\ncybernetics that was not possible before. Furthermore, it increases the precision of modeling and measurement\nrequired for steering these economies. This results in a data driven regulatory process, as shown in Figure 5.\nHowever, the advances of machine learned models [Jordan and Mitchell 2015] is a consequence of the growth\nof the digital economy that captures a large amount of economic data. This data is largely controlled by large\ntech firms operating platform based services which are often subject to algorithmic bias [Garcia 2016], [Lewis\nand Westlund 2015],[S\u00e6tra 2019], [Von Foerster 2003]. The stateful nature of cryptoeconomic systems has the\npotential to cede control over data back to the users of these platforms, if privacy by design is considered in the\nmodeling of the cryptoeconomic systems and their applications [Voshmgir 2019a].\n\nhttps://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e\n\nhere's another essay that I found to be really nice\n\n\n\nWeb3 project without loops. The challenge is dwindling $TOKEN supply and no long-term sustainability.\n\nThe main problem with this is that the founding team needs to continually dip into its supply of tokens to fund itself. That supply continues to dwindle, especially if the project has to pivot towards hitting product-market fit. With each dilution event, the founders\u2019 incentive to make the project succeed is further diminished. If the supply gets badly reduced, the team will need to sell company stock or a second token, which then risks misalignment of incentives.\n\nCan we do better? The image below shows an improvement, which some Web3 projects are doing. Taking a cue from businesses and nations, it introduces revenue generation (bottom right). Revenue is then looped back to Workers, in a curated fashion (middle-left). Projects are chosen based on growth potential and alignment with the project\u2019s mission. Funding can go to the founding team and other project teams. They all perform *work* to grow the $TOKEN value and network revenue. And the loop continues.\n\n\n\nRevenue generation can draw on ideas from Web1 & Web2 businesses \u2014 but with less extractive rates. Importantly, the token must be designed such that its value rises as usage rises.\n\nBut there\u2019s still one big problem: too little revenue, too late. I\u2019ll elaborate.\n\nIf rates are too high, it will either get forked and re-deployed with lower rates, or it won\u2019t get adopted because it\u2019s seen as too extractive.\nIf rates are too low (and usage isn\u2019t sufficient) then revenue is too low.\nEither way, teams won\u2019t have enough funding to keep growing the project. They will stoically or heroically keep going for a while, until they can\u2019t feed their family. Some may pull through. And most will be forced to stop, at which point the project begins its fade into oblivion.\n\n(6) Web3 Sustainability / Growth Models \u2014 A Fuller Picture\nGood news! We can overcome the challenge of \u201ctoo little revenue, too late\u201d. It takes a key change: rather than disburse all the tokens at the beginning of the project, disburse a large fraction of tokens over a much longer period of time to the workers that are adding value to the project. This gives teams a longer runway to iterate towards product-market fit (PMF), and more funds to catalyze growth once PMF is achieved.\n\nI call this the Web3 Sustainability Loop. The image below illustrates this. It has parallels to successful nations and successful businesses. At its heart is a loop, designed for \u201csnowball effect\u201d growth of the ecosystem. The Workers (center) do *work* to help grow the Web3 Project Ecosystem (right). Apps and services generate revenue, using the Web3 project\u2019s tools. A non-extractive fraction of that revenue is looped back (arrow looping from right to left) as Network revenue to the Web3 community: to Buy & Burn $TOKEN (bottom left) and back to workers curated by the community according (center-left). To catalyze growth and ensure decent funding in early days, Network rewards (left) also feed to Workers.\n\n\n\nWeb3 sustainability/growth model including an \u201couter wrapper\u201d that includes $TOKEN disbursement over time as a tool, in addition to network revenue.\n\nHere\u2019s the loop, in words:\n\nProjects are proposed, and curated, by the community.\nProjects are funded by Network revenue, and Network reward.\nAs projects do *work* and add value, network revenue goes up and $TOKEN goes up, and ever-more funding goes to the community.\n\n\"From an ecosystem perspective, if a project gets funding from outside the ecosystem, then it counts towards the value-add number, not to the value-spent number. This incentivizes projects to seek external funding, such as matching investments or quadratic funding.\"\n\nValue can only be added to an ecosystem if the core product being built (by core devs) has last-mile apps for users (by app devs), which users can discover and find useful (go-to-market work). It\u2019s a chain going from core product \u2192 dapps \u2192 discovery & usage \u2192 actual value add.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1300723135076093952?s=20&t=MSD9OSy34xRIMio_NBeA0w\n\nhere's a tweetstorm related to this article\n\nhttps://youtube.com/clip/UgkxXnMHir7wy6sxD1MQ4mofl0zQmn-1ojMu\n\n\ud83e\udde0 \ud83d\udcaf  <@753720709032968213> would love to do another lunch n learn sometime about your learnings\n\nOhh good idea!!\n\nI\u2019ll be back mid-December\n\nLet\u2019s do one then like the 11th\n\ni'll be back from india dec 18th!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/nathanlawkc/status/1596842009364500481 , not sure if there's much research but found it interesting \ud83d\ude42\n\nNICE! ---- When k < 0, the space expands forever.

I find their docs / process very interesting. i think we probably could learn a fair bit from these folks.\n\nI\u2019ve printed it out and I\u2019m bringing it on the plane. I feel that a few reads will stick it. It\u2019s important not to be intimidated by texts like this! It\u2019s like Feynman said - you don\u2019t just read a paper instantly - it takes some time. There are new words and phrases here, and the unfamiliar is the only thing getting in the way of reading. Skimming, relaxing, and just kind of floating over the paper without judging yourself for not immediately getting it is important.\n\nI know the author well. But! The first time I met him, my first thought was that he spoke like a textbook. And I thought he was trying to be official And unnecessarily formal! \n\nit was hard for me to hear through that. After talking with him a lot more, and then joining a working group with him around solving problems at the edge of what\u2019s possible with data DAOs - I will say that he has a very precise way of saying things, but once I\u2019ve gotten used to it the precision is incredible. I feel like once I read it I should make some notes and post some here!\n\nThanks much for sharing this. The (totally unexplained) analytic frame of 'political economy' via input/output or marginal analysis makes the argument somewhat wordy and inaccessible/obscure in places, but I appreciated its clarity on the challenges DAOs will face and how to prepare for them. \n\nSection IV is the most important imo and also the most concrete, so I'll share my pull-quotes from the more 'abstract'/generalized earlier sections:\n\nFrom Section I:\n\n> The questions of central relevance to governance of impersonal organizations are those surrounding disagreement or dispute among members.\n\nFrom Section II:\n\n> Therefore, the potential value of new organizational forms cannot be understood without a firm grounding in the efficiencies (and equities) that existing legacy systems have provided. The benefits of traditional organizational hierarchies can be summarized as attracting specialized individuals and concentrating their incentives to make value-adding decisions on the part of the larger whole. Furthermore, creating an organizational shell within which people can coordinate their productive activity has benefits in terms of reduction of transaction costs (Coase 1937) and incentive problems associated with investment (Williamson 1985; 2003).\u00a0\n\n> Thus, one overarching structural weakness to which DAOs are subject is those of the costs associated with democratization of decision-making among organization members. In many contexts, this low engagement is rational \u2013 it is inefficient to vote on the operating and governance decisions of every organization against which someone has a claim against future returns or output.\n\n>  Nonetheless, these existing systems of private governance have their own serious drawbacks, which makes the narrative thus far unfair to DAOs\u2019 potential. This is for two reasons: intrinsic (ideological) valuations and the possibility for ongoing institutional innovation. These also provide the basis for identification of the set of core values likely to create a community constitution whose formalization (and ongoing gap filling role in cases of Knightian uncertainty) is one that is a direct input to resilience, as a function of the internal political economy that this constitution reflects and thus shapes in an ongoing sense.\n\n> Therefore, the costs are lower to DAO organization than a strictly economic calculus would suggest due to the tendency for those engaged in these communities to intrinsically value the process itself, and that the sustainability of a DAO\u2019s governance will hinge on how well it can attract members who have this intrinsic motivation (alongside economic or philanthropic alignment with the DAOs purpose). This intrinsic valuation for DAO governance means that a subset of DAO projects will succeed in overcoming the relative inefficiencies of decentralized governance noted thus far.\n\n> Therefore, there are dynamic reasons to be cautiously optimistic about the institutional development that is likely to occur as DAOs emerge, compete for members, occasionally spectacularly fail, and eventually converge upon efficient design features that enable them to capture private and philanthropic market share by finding a niche where this form of governance is more efficient, and/or is able to attract a subset of members (whether investors or donors) who are willing to pay a premium for this specific form of governance.\n\nhttps://advanced-hindsight.com/\n\nOh wow! This is amazing!\n\nFrom Section III:\n\n> The study of legal transitions identifies how any institutional change tends to create winners and losers compared to the status quo, a direct testament to how the outcome of any given collective choice process will be a subject of disagreement in part due to the way in which the change affects the balance of interests among organization members.\n\n> Notably, DAOs\u2019 constitutive choices tend to involve forms of democratic input as a function of network activity or staked value, which makes them necessarily reflect a form of constitutional ordering more so than traditional firm governance. This means DAOs will be subject to internal collective choice dilemmas at a greater level than the centralized autocratic decision-making that is associated with private economic organizations. More generally, an organization\u2019s chosen purpose, through reifying a constitutive set of shared values, defining an internal political economy, and a set of competing organizations which members can plausibly join, is a principal determinant of the heterogeneity of member\u2019s preferences with respect to collective action.\n\n> Even though collective action poses representative losses to all members, these losses increase as heterogeneity of governance preferences increases within a given organization, because of the mechanical way in which heterogeneity of governance preferences make collective action more costly. A chosen purpose for an organization greatly defines an internal plurality of interests whose gains and losses to any institutional change in turn partially determine the scope of institutional change that is possible. Similarly, like-minded individuals can disagree in good faith about how to proceed in cases of uncertainty, and the more the unforeseen event is unlike anything that came previously, the more this disagreement is likely.undefined\u00a0A plurality of visions as to how to proceed are thus themselves a critical source of disagreement for governance of large impersonal organizations. Finally, competitor\u2019s governance and production choices themselves constrain the choices of any given organization, such that a chosen purpose (through determining competitive substitute purposes) is also choosing a set of constraints of governance decisions that are possible to resolve political economic and uncertainty-related disputes within a given organization. This makes institutions to accommodate disagreement as necessary for all collective action organizations at impersonal scale, institutions whose value increases given divergence in shared values within a particular organization.\n\nThis last chunk essentially defines three sources of discord among DAO members: (1) the constitution of their shared values, with its differing interpretations, (2) the plurality of visions that these interpretations give rise to, and (3) the external frictions the organization's actions are liable to produce.\n\nThe fourth and final sections give examples and some institutional mechanisms for handling these disputes, which I'm still mulling over as they are directly related to NetaDAO's operating agreement that I'm helping draft.\n\nYou REALLY got the essence of this essay. Oh my gosh.\n\nThese notes totally make it possible for me to parse this work in a really solid way now.\n\nIn real life, Eric talks like he writes. It\u2019s pretty incredible.\n\n<a:OH_peepoNerd:850484888649859072>\n\nWould love to see the operating agreement if it\u2019s public at some point.\n\nI\u2019m personally running into an issue where myself and another party worked on a project, but organizational debt added up and the cybernetic feedback loop turned negative.\n\nI like how Eric points out the gap between starting a traditional org with a background of law or finance or business, and then the fact that anybody can create a DAO, yet not necessarily have the tools to do that organizational process Or any experience with procedure in this shape whatsoever. \n\nAnd that gap can get groups of well-meaning people into some pretty miserable interpersonal conditions and cycles. I\u2019m definitely not as articulate is eric on these points, which is why I\u2019m so interested in reading his work. I\u2019m really glad you got something out of this, and I am super impressed by the summary of points. It\u2019s going to be super helpful to me as well.\n\nI\u2019d love to see a diagram, or maybe just create one of this gap. People go to undergrad and graduate school just to be able to deal with the basics of these human complexities. People go to court over issues that are not well defined. And yet all of us, few who have degrees, and more importantly, experience in diplomacy, organization, bookkeeping, and law, are almost arbitrarily creating these social constructs, and then getting hit with organizational issues after the initial feel good period is done.\n\nI have an OA draft up under the NetaDAO #governance-legal channel. Once we officially get our LLC incorporation process going (I have to put up proposal today), we'll have a 30-day open 'Assembly' to hash out the OA more exactly. What I have on the OA (and our separate Org Chart) right now is mostly structural descriptions of where everything/everyone is. Section IV here has given me some ideas for thinking about handling disagreements and mediating issues among subDAOs/etc.\n\nI\u2019m on UTC -7 so super late for me but this has been really cool getting to learn more about what you\u2019re working on. I have to join the Discord and check it out.\n\nI feel there's a lot of openness on where the emphasis on \"autonomy\" happens or can be placed in a DAO. The essay presents DAOs as incurring higher operating costs on the assumption that the autonomy is that of the total DAO. I suppose one could also interpret 'DAO autonomy' as meaning a collective empowering the autonomy of its subunits or representative structures.\n\nThis ambiguity likewise exists around interpretations of the phrase \"We the People,\" where it's been argued (in the US) that \"the people\" is the pure/direct count of individuals OR the group of states. The Constitution didn't so much resolve the problem as accept both: the House of Representatives was supposed to be proportional to the population, while the Senate was a fixed representation of states.\n\nI've been thinking about all this recently as models for NetaDAO and for DAOs more generally, so I'm happy to geek out and share with others. <:PES5_NerdWow:827518508409683978>\n\ni really like the approach described here for budget selection:\n\nhttps://blog.colony.io/introducing-budgetbox/#thinking-inside-the-box\n\neffectively, they have voters \"play a game\" where they select pairwise preferences (i think X is more important than Y) for a subset of all possible pairs. they then aggregate those preferences into a budget distribution. this reminds me a fair bit of the recent Osmosis grants proposal and seems like a reasonably proposal for a better way to manage DAO budgeting.\n\nin our case, \"budget distribution\" would likely go to subDAOs who are then charged with executing within their budget\n\nI read over this conversation yesterday, printed out paper also, and really appreciated <@503057962852548608> notes too! (Thanks!)  Then today at a web3 Governance conference here in Melbourne I met Eric and found you\u2019re really right! He does talk like he rights. He is next level.\n\nIs there any info on how they actually set up their pairwise preference quizzes? I can imagine that going in a lot of directions.\n\ngreat question :) the stuff i saw there was pretty hazy. it seems like they give each person a random fixed-size selection of pair, and ranks their preference. then, they use (and i quote) \"machine learning\" to build some probability based ordering of the options which they turn into funding gauges.\n\nit's pretty hazy, but the article links to some additional material which may have the details\n\nI posted a rough draft of my Orientation to our Operating Agreement work over on the server. Hopefully I'll revise sections 2 and 4 before Monday, but would be interested in any feedback based on your research on organizational design if you have some time. <:PES_Embarrassed:643089267932790797> <:pepethumbsup:774587160731844649>\n\ncc <@904452225554874379>\n\nhttps://noidea.dog/glue\n\nGreat article about glue!\n\nReading research papers can be intimidating.\n\nThe key is not trying to understand everything in the first pass.

A second pass to grasp the main messages of the paper while ignoring the details such as proofs or derivations. Write down comments for the parts which are unclear.\n\n3.

The connection-oriented cluster matching model seems like a productive start for DAOs/chains that are planning to use subDAOs. The \"coarseness\"/abstraction of the argument left me wondering how exactly to measure such things as contributions and group belonging per se, but the proof of concept seems valid if those can be satisfactorily worked out.\n\nThe issue of measuring contributor contribution for Quadratic Funding (if it isn't simply a dollar/token amount, but also involves 'sweat equity' and other less fungible modes of input), is probably parallel to the problem in Weyl and Posner's Quadratic Voting formulas, in which voters are issued \"voice shares\" that they use to make their voices louder or quieter on certain issues... Weyl and Posner present this as a way of protecting minority rights outside judicial oversight, but that's only if you can issue 'voice shares' in a way that satisfies participants. It's possible to simply drain/fatigue some groups' shares by putting their rights up for referendum, thus depleting their input in other areas of policy. Put otherwise, the QV model might just as quickly accentuate extremism and polarization, especially since caring about more policy initiatives reduces the weight of your vote on any individual initiative. The same happens with measuring nonfungible contributions for QF, especially when people are contributing across multiple operational initiatives.\n\nAbsolutely agree about accentuating a gazillion micro-dystopias or worse -- I personally think commodified labor is the issue and something like a graph of work (directed, one can only hope *loopy thoughts*) could be an interesting data structure to use when formally defining notions of fairness or social choice\n\nWith a dependency graph of what is accomplished, one can more precisely specify the geometry of fairness, and retroactive compensation can proceed along the lines of free energy minimization principle or similar work graph traversal mechanism\n\nQF / QV come from a good place, but in the end can only operate within the ontologies of modern monetary theory or principal agent in a bureaucratic nation-state\n\nYep, I very much like the idea of tying organizational funding to 'consilience' or broad agreement across organizational members. And I found much to ponder on their proposal to weight consilience by clusters/groups vs rational isolated individuals. It seems that it will always be a 'political' issue how to measure groups and their overlaps, with an inescapable judicial component involved (even if it's handled by 'ordinary'/nontrained members).\n\nFor something completely(?) different: https://youtu.be/AP3zeHyWakw\n\nhttps://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/particle-lenia/\n\n> As we see, the total system energy is mostly decreasing through a series of phase transitions between different formations. Nevertheless there are intervals where the energy is increasing. Why is this happening? Shouldn't the system that follows the energy gradient, eventually find a stable local minima? Turns out that there is one subtle detail which makes the dynamics much more interesting. Each particle greedily minimizes its own energy without considering its influence on other particles.\n> [....]\n> We can see that the global optimization indeed drives the system into a stable low-energy state. Once we switch to the local rule, the system escapes this state and enters a dynamic attractor similar to the one from the previous simulation.\n\n<:pog:1034269207594020864>\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800919310067\n\nenergy sections are just excellent and echo / converge on many of the essential tenets of what we've been working on over at Plurigrid for many months\n\nAlso the money / debt parts are quite on point IMO!

And then you end up getting closer and closer to the conceptual labor work that goes into defining work as a creative director, and it turns out that to do it well, you actually just need to work with a real human.\n\nthe outlines on this remind me of the borderlands video game\n\ni have never heard of this person. thank you for sharing. their style reminds me of Chris Riddell who illustrated some books i liked as a kid.\n\nFrom the other night!\n\nGradient theory\n\nOriginal paper on DAOs from a home automation perspective\n\n\n\n\n\nok - and something for fun!\n\n\n\ncreaturescards.pdf for more!\n\n\n\nThe level of organization in even the simplest living systems is so remarkable that many, if not most, non-scientists believe that we need to go outside science to explain it. This belief is subtly reinforced by the fact that many scientists still think the emergence of life was a fortuitous accident that required a good roll of the molecular dice, in a place where the conditions are just so, in a Universe where the laws of physics are just right.\n\nThe opposing view is that matter tends to organize itself according to general principles, making the eventual emergence of life inevitable. Such principles would not require any modifications of the laws of physics, but would come from a better understanding of how complex behaviour arises from the interaction of simple components.\n\nIn their book Into the Cool, Eric Schneider and Dorion Sagan claim that non-equilibrium thermodynamics provides the key principle that has been lacking. They review its application to topics ranging from fluid dynamics and meteorology to the origin of life, ecology, plant physiology, and evolutionary biology, and even speculate about its relevance to health, economics and metaphysics. The book contains a wealth of good references and is worth buying for this reason alone.\n\n\"The truly dangerous ideas in science tend to be those that threaten the collective ego of humanity and knock us further off our pedestal of centrality.\"\n\n\"The dangerous idea is this: the purpose of life is to disperse energy.\"\n\nhttps://www.edge.org/response-detail/10674#:~:text=More%20generally%2C%20as%20stated%20by,example%2C%20in%20temperature%20or%20pressure.\n\n\"Nobel laureate Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was one of the first to articulate the hypothesis, as part of his famous \"What is Life\" lectures in Dublin in 1943. More recently, Jeffrey Wicken, Harold Morowitz, Eric Schneider and others have taken this concept considerably further, buoyed by results from a range of studies, particularly within ecology. Schneider and Dorian Sagan provide an excellent summary of this hypothesis in their recent book, \"Into the Cool\".\"\n\n<@676640406875930644> re: wet bulb conditons\n\n\"If a thermometer is wrapped in a water-moistened cloth, it will behave differently. The drier and less humid the air is, the faster the water will evaporate. The faster water evaporates, the lower the thermometer's temperature will be relative to air temperature.:\n\n\"Water can evaporate only if the air around it can absorb more water. This is measured by comparing how much water is in the air to the maximum that could be in the air\u2014the relative humidity. 0% means the air is completely dry, and 100% means the air contains all the water it can hold in the present circumstances and it cannot absorb any more water (from any source).\"\n\n\"This is part of the cause of apparent temperature in humans. The drier the air, the more moisture it can take up beyond what is already in it, and the easier it is for extra water to evaporate. The result is that sweat evaporates more quickly in drier air, cooling down the skin faster. If the relative humidity is 100%, no water can evaporate, and cooling by sweating or evaporation is not possible.\"\n\nDefinition: The wet-bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that may be achieved by evaporative cooling of a water-wetted, ventilated surface.\n\n---\n\nAnyway -- there will be more of these!\n\n---\n\nBack to the \"Into the Cool\"\n\n\"The twist is to claim that the need to reduce energy gradients drives a tendency towards increasing complexity in both living and non-living systems. In their words: \u201cEven before natural selection, the second law \u2018selects\u2019, from the kinetic, thermodynamic, and chemical options available, those systems best able to reduce gradients under given constraints.\u201d For example, they argue that the reason a climax forest replaces an earlier transition forest is that it is more efficient at fixing energy from the Sun, which also reduces the temperature gradient. They claim that the competition to reduce gradients introduces a force for selection, in which less effective mechanisms to reduce gradients are replaced by more effective ones. They argue that this is the fundamental reason why both living and non-living systems tend to display higher levels of organization over time.\"\n\n\"This is an intriguing idea but I am not convinced that it makes sense. The selection process that the authors posit is never clearly defined, and they never explain why, or in what sense, it necessarily leads to increasing complexity. No one would dispute that the second law of thermodynamics is important for understanding the functioning of complex systems. Being out of equilibrium is a necessary condition for a physical phenomenon to display interesting complex behaviour, even if \u2018interesting\u2019 remains difficult to define. But the authors' claim that non-equilibrium thermodynamics explains just about everything falls flat. For example, consider a computer. No one would dispute that a power supply is essential. Even for a perfectly efficient computer, thermodynamics tells us that it takes at least kT ln2 energy units to erase a bit, where T is the temperature and k is the Boltzmann constant. But the need for power tells us nothing about what makes a laptop different from a washing machine. To understand how a computer works, and what it can and cannot do, requires the theory of computation, which is a logical theory that is disconnected from thermodynamics. The power supply can be designed by the same person who designs them for washing machines.\" https://www.nature.com/articles/436627a\n\nI'm interested in both the idea and the critiques of the idea\n\nI also like this one \"Life relies on the ability of matter to store information and to implement functional relationships, which allow organisms to maintain their form and execute purposeful behaviours that enhance their survival. Such complex order depends on the rules by which matter interacts. It may well be that many of the details are not important, and that there are general principles that might allow us to determine when the result will be organization and when it will be chaos. But this cannot be understood in terms of thermodynamics alone.\"\n\nfun stuff: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Is-the-climate-system-an-anticipatory-system-that-Rubin-Crucifix/9bb9f270adf88eda156b8852142b7fa41fd6dac5\n\n<@755585146140491956> <@676640406875930644> <@181607258512162816> <@898769611200274482> Here's the paper on Awe from the day before!\n\n<@755585146140491956> I tried writing every morning when waking up so far.\n\nIt's been amazing!\n\nyesss thank you for sending all this\n\nNP!\n\nlol.

Although the author levels human life down to mammalian life, I think there's some merit to the argument that humans, endowed not simply with cognition and language, but cognition _through_ language (i.e., we don't merely think and communicate, we also think _with and through_ the means of our communication), are different from animals and that our cognition is significantly shaped by this incursion of language. There are several texts which have dealt with the havoc that language acquisition plays on human mirror neurons and the consequent damming of spontaneous human sympathy/emotion; I believe Rizzolatti (who won the Nobel for his work on mirror neurons) or one of his original team members has written about the rewiring of the brain due to language acquisition, good if you read Italian, but if not another important source is Angela Friederici's _Language in Our Brain: The Origins of a Uniquely Human Capacity._ I would argue it's through this sabotage of spontaneous affect by language that 'symbols' or 'the symbolic' as such becomes operative in human biology and especially in human societies/organizations (which are, I think this paper  would argue, themselves products of biology). It's worth noting imo that this rewiring happens between the ages of 3-11, when the child is not just mastering language but more specifically learning to use negation operators and to speak of what is not, of reality versus possibility or fantasy. For this reason there's a sempiternal dysfunction and disorientation to human reality.\n\nThis is really a minor point I'm making, but it ramifies down into a comment from Section 3.2:\n\n> But when trading stocks, playing video games or building shopping centers, there is no instinctual \u2018full\u2019 signal in modern brains - so we become addicted to the \u2018unexpected reward\u2019 of the next encounter, episode, or email, at an ever increasing pace\n\nI too question whether there are instinctual signals for anything as specific as \"trading stocks,\" \"playing video games,\" etc\u2014but I don't tie my suspicion to a \"stone-age mind\" hypothesis. Rather, I adopt a view of the human organism as primarily formed and responding to linguistically-bound and hence aim-inhibited drives rather than natural instincts\u2014desire wears Reason like a mask, and it is easy to interpret some masks as nature. What perhaps is most 'natural' to human nature is the fact of masking or doubling nature itself. In some sense, we might think of language as an originary mask or double for the world, and which leaves much of our human world subject to the vicissitudes of treaties and contracts and promises, but also the violation of those\u2014meaning war, a phenomenon that seems alien to even our most closely related animal kin. (One here might think of Franz Kafka's observation that the animals can be so sanguine because _they_ never left the Garden of Eden...)\n\nFrom Section 3.4:\n\n> We have great intentions for the future, until the future becomes today. Our neocortex can imagine them, but we are emotionally blind to long-term issues like climate change or energy depletion.\u00a0_Emotionally, the future isn\u2019t real._\n\nI don't buy that our brain anatomy means \"the future\" is only a conceptual imagining rather than an affective reality. Discrepancies between present descriptions of our preferred future states and those actual future states are surely more multifactored than that. Emerson's quip that \"Our moods do not believe in each other\" would be a better entry.\n\nFrom Section 3.5:\n\n> We are also primed to cooperate with our in-group whether that is a small business, large corporation, or even a nation-state - to obtain monetary (or in earlier times, physical) surplus.\n\nI agree obtaining surplus is a major purpose of many cooperative enterprises (though not all), but I wonder how much this construction has things backward: it's surplus that _causes_ human cooperation\u2014e.g., surplus of feeling/affect or even cognition, such as one finds around the anarchist concept of \"mutual aid.\" \n\nFrom Section 3.6:\n\n> Since the Neolithic, human society has organized around growth of surplus, initially measured physically e.g. grain, now measured by digital claims on physical surplus, (or money)\u00a0\n\nThe slide or sleight of hand which converts 3.5's \"monetary [...] surplus\" to the total equivocation of surplus and money\u2014needs some pressure put on it, less because I think it's wrong than because it's so suggestive it needs more unpacking (for me). On one hand, I could imagine \"money is (a proxy for) surplus\" as superficially compatible with George Gilder's definition of money as a measure or proxy for wealth; on the other hand, that superficial compatibility is broken by acknowledging that Gilder's definition of wealth is knowledge, a store of learning, and it's difficult to know what \"surplus knowledge\" would exactly mean, and whether it would bear an historically acknowledged relation to surplus grain. Though I think one possible definition of \"surplus knowledge\" in the above sense could be: philosophy or philosophizing, the over-thinking of things. <:cPES_Wink:623401321382281226> On that note, I would probably want to trace the money concept to one of the earliest human institutions, i.e., promising. Promises are \"performatives\" in the sense that they do not simply describe the world but _change_ it or _enact_ their contents. (Other performatives include the marital vow \"I do\" and the christening of ships, neither of which describe the world as it is but change or add some surplus to how the world can be described; this surplus in language that has physical weight might be called\u2014why not\u2014'libido,' a psychical energetics at some fractured remove from physical energetics.) Consequently one way to understand performatives is as testing or sounding the strength of a social field, and that is why I describe promising as among the oldest of human institutions. The money concept seems to me an outgrowth of this promissory institution of language rather than commodity exchange\u2014and I should note that for this reason I also decline 'chartalist' or State-based theories of money as overstating their case. Anyway, I don't disagree with money and surplus being linked, but I want it finer tuned. Anne Carson's _Economy of the Unlost_ explores one of the first ardent users of coinage, the poet Simonides of Keos, who charged for his verses, and which poses some surprisingly subtle problems with both commodity and chartalist theories of money.\n\n(On this point I will add that at the recent Game of Nodes session, the host kind of needled Jake on Juno's Prop 16 drama and asked why companies would build on chains where their assets can be voted away. However, the real question is: Why do they do that already, rather than taking to the high seas and declaring independence as pirates? A main reason: actually a lot of people don't like shopping with pirates. The US recently seized SBF's personal Robinhood stocks, and I think many people feel that is the correct move. The social design aspect of the crypto revolution is an essential part of its long-term promise and appeal, not something to be ashamed of or shy away from; and we shouldn't cede way to romantic but reckless (and almost always cruel) fantasies of absolute piratical sovereignty.)\n\nLil D strikes again! \u2728\u2728\u2728\n\nI read Sections 4.0-4.2 as introducing but somewhat skirting or downplaying the mystery of homeostasis. It sounds sensible and 'economic' enough to say:\n\n> Organisms utilize foraging strategies that optimize energy intake vs. energy expenditure adjusted for time and risk.\n\nbut if organisms really did merely optimize in this way, then why the hell are there so many organisms with so many varying sets of (alleged) optimization? And if bodies are optimized for homeostasis, then why do they so often fail to achieve it? Another way of putting this might be: Why bother with _any_ nonzero homeostasis? Zero intake and zero expenditure are ostensibly the easiest or most sustainable of all homeostatic equilibria. It might be the case that Life is \"miraculous\" or some kind of separate or counterforce to the inorganic; but another possibility is that the inorganic itself might not designate a zero-sum inertia... Again my point here isn't so much to suggest the claim is wrong or inaccurate as that it could benefit from deeper exfoliation.\n\nFrom Section 4.6:\n\n> _Economists view capital, labor and human creativity as primary and energy secondary or absent. The opposite is, in fact, true. We are energy blind._\n\nI appreciate the rhetorical flare. I don't know that it makes sense to relegate either of those to primary/secondary (or absent!?) roles; they seem to me equals, like trying to decide whether the firefighter who connects the hydrant or the firefighter who holds the hose are more responsible for fighting the fire. Arguing about primacy of one part over another here seems to be more politically motivated than guided by careful reasoning, since both are actually necessary for the end result. That said, I do love this provocation, not least because of the way it sets up the punch here from Section 4.7:\n\n> Technology is an expression of the available energy we can exploit (Brockway, 2013). What we call \u201ctechnological progress\u201d at any time is mostly the development of the capital base to support an ever-greater throughput of available energy at a later time.\u00a0\n\nas well as this from Section 4.9:\n\n> Organisms that require more energy to find food than the food contains, will die. We only get away with this because our institutions and policies treat the energy subsidy from fossil hydrocarbons as interest, not principal.\n\nBack to the money concept in Section 4.10:\n\n> Contrary to what is taught in economics textbooks, money is not lent out from existing wealth\u2013 it is created (Werner, 2014;\u00a0Ament, 2019). This new money eventually gets spent on a good or service which will contain\u00a0embodied energy.\u00a0Money is a claim on energy yet its creation is not tethered to energy availability or cost.\n\nHere there's again sleight of hand or too-fast analysis that joins several things together that may appear the same to us only by historical contingency rather than natural necessity. I mean in particular the confusion of the institution of money with the institution of banking, which are several if not separable institutions. The central motor of today's banking, i.e., making loans by creating deposits in accordance with fractional reserve policies, is the definition of what Nakomoto called the \"double-spend problem\"\u2014I say \"today's banking\" but it was a problem in other times and places as well, albeit the process of making and taking loans has varied widely under differing jurisdictions and monetary systems. Finally, I think that \"money is a claim on energy\" is accurate in some reductionist calculus, but it becomes less clear in cases of avarice (or what Aristotle dubbed \"incontinence\") or under wide-scale financialization, which George Gilder defines as the social condition in which money _becomes_ wealth directly, rather than money _being a measure_ of wealth. Still, I'll accept the reductionist calculus as holding good on some 'ultimate' or long-term horizon, where the creation of money runs up against energy availability.\n\nI particularly enjoyed Section 4.11:\n\n> This makes debt more accurately an \u2018intertemporal transfer of\u00a0consumption\u2019 [rather than consumption preferences].\n\nHere again there's a reductionist calculus at work, but I think it has heuristic value. The argument that debt\u2014or, the creation of money untethered from 'real' energy available or 'real' productive forces\u2014is effectively a robbery of future generations is a powerful idea that goes back to the forming of modern republics. Marquis de Sade, the namesake of sadism and an overall degenerate, turned out to write some political tracts of interest while locked away in the Bastille, including a pamphlet, \"One More Effort, Frenchmen, If You Wish To Be Republicans,\" inserted within _Philosophy in the Bedroom_, that effectively argues for the severance of money and state as the necessary final step for truly republican revolution. But of course the issue here was: sever it from state (and hence from gold), _and then what?_ No other systems or technology existed then that could fully replace gold; the printing presses were the best technology for monetary innovation at the time and the lessons of those experiments have formed what we today call 'economics.' A stumbling point I thought showed up at the end of this section here:\n\n> Thus debt can be seen as a tool humans use to access an energy gradient, and the resulting goods and services. Debt has been referred to as \u2018fake energy\u2019 (Weyler, 2011). More accurately, debt moves real energy and consumption from the future, to the present, unsustainably. But it is fake in the sense that to pay back the debt, we have to also pay back the energy. One could say this amount (and related consumption) is \u201cborrowed\u201d energy.\n\nBy the paper's own classification, there are two types of technology: Type 1 that enhances or innovates energy sources, and Type 2 that deploys energy for labor or other ends. Type 1 technology, the mere possibility of which seems to lend credence to the view of a non-zero sum inorganic/natural world, would be the way that debt 'de-frauds' itself. (Sorry for the abuse of defraud.) There's a story in some economics text I've read of an agrarian society where the people believed that if one farmer grew more yams than the other farmers, it was because that farmer had used magic to spirit the other farmers' yams away, and therefore deserved to be punished. This 'zero-sum' view of wealth and productivity is recapitulated here in terms of global energy availability rather than local soil fertility, but at the risk inviting futurism, this latter-day zero-sum view of energy availability seems to depend on ignoring any interstellar or interplanetary energy sources that may become available in the coming decades, and which may make our zero-sum punishments today seem like the punishments of yam farmers in other places.\n\nOn Section 4.12: \n\n> After basic needs are met, the best things in life are free.\n\nI'm dubious about the whole section and its use of social/psychological data, but I'm still sympathetic to the broader point that money doesn't buy happiness.\n\nFigure 8 from Section 5.0 got a chuckle out of me:\n\n\n\nI don't know what monetary/economic history was consulted for this chart (which is admitted to be \"not to scale\"), but I don't think that money creation and available energy were ever as correlated as all that suggests. Even focusing on the narrower band of time specified, i.e., the dawn of the Industrial Era, it's hard to find much corroboration for the claim that money creation was bound to energy availability. There's even some weird implication here that previous financial crises didn't happen or were somehow trivialized (appearing but as blips on a smooth curve) when compared to that crisis caused by the future outstripping of energy. A broader sense of monetary/economic history would possibly sharpen this argument by demonstrating financial busts/booms (and credit creation more generally) relative to energy sources and Type 1 tech availability at the time, but I suspect the results could be more mixed and raise deeper questions about the relation of energy and monetary systems. I found myself questioning the historical bona fides once again with the following claim:\n\n> These changes allowed economic growth to continue until it hit a wall with conventional finance in 2008 (Point C)\u2013 at which point central banks and global governments were forced to essentially redesign the entire financial system.\n\nI don't think that many people consider post-1970s global finance to be \"conventional finance,\" even if its surprising longevity has given it the appearance of convention. The abandonment of the gold standard and introduction of the \"currency float\" by Nixon and Friedman has meant that today currency trading and speculation make up more global financial activity than almost every other sector combined. (A point I find interesting about Friedman: he also argued that abandoning the gold standard would almost dangerously centralize power over labor value to central bankers and governments, and he consequently proposed a full UBI as a counter-weight to the corruption by printers and speculators.) Indeed, the 1970s or post-Bretton Woods monetary system became known as \"monetarism\" and distanced itself from both market 'fundamentalists' and Keynesian 'radicals', yet tended to do so in practice by adopting the worst and ignoring the best of each.\n\n> We are now heading towards Point D, where our global monetary representations of reality continue to decouple from the underlying biophysical reality (red curve).\n\nInasmuch as I would trace the money concept to the performative institution (or symbolic 'surplus' in physical reality) of promise-making, -breaking, and -keeping, I wonder whether viewing money supply in terms of \"biophysical reality\" or 'real forces of production' (as commodity theory might prefer) isn't missing or distorting something essential about the money concept, if not the 'real' reality itself.\n\nFrom Section 5.1:\n\n> Rather, we have a strong preference for positive experiences in the present moment (Hagens, 2010). Even the ecologically literate will avoid \u2018sustainable\u2019 practices that accomplish equal goals but require more time (Penn, 2019).\n\nHere finally comes another nonnegotiable force, perhaps even more difficult to massage than energy availability: time. To the position that \"money is a claim on energy\" can be opposed the more common understanding that \"money is time,\" more specifically that any healthy monetary system stores/measures the time-value and time-costs of individual and collective learning. \n\nFrom Section 5.2:\n\n> The emergent property of 7.7 billion humans going through their daily lives following simple rules like these is a \u2018Superorganism\u2019 with a 17\u00a0TW metabolism.\n\nThis and the ensuing description through 6.1 of the humanity Superorganism as made up of oil pipes and data cables and orbiting satellites put me in mind of Reza Negarastani's _Cyclonopedia_, a horror-theory novel in which the Middle East/planet becomes cursedly sentient through oil.\n\n> In principle a superorganism could be super intelligent but ours is not.\n\nBanger line, and one of the cooler features made known to us by dynamical systems research: our universe can be written (truly, a uni-verse, a poem of the Oneness of all existence) without for all that having an Author. But immediately following that is this:\n\n> \u00a0In the 1930s economists chose GDP as a metric to track economic activity, not as an end goal. Yet almost 100 years later, our economies unconsciously, relentlessly, pursue the GDP carrot, often toward frivolous endeavors that promise the greatest financial return in the shortest time.\n\nwhich again for me calls into question the overall familiarity with economic/monetary history and policy. And from here follows a long stream of Sections that I find to be of less clear relevance: is the argument that if less money that had been created, there would be less climate change? Again back to this 'ultimate' zero-sum position that sounds sensible but might be ignoring some reality.\n\nIn Section 8:\n\n> Many challenges we face appear as classic social traps, whereby short-term social pressures guide individual behavior in opposition to the best long-run interest of the individual and society (Costanza, 1987).\n\nThis \"social trap\" is sometimes called the Prisoners' Dilemma and describes any decision space where agents would achieve the best outcome for each and all by cooperating but can also achieve a meager to moderate outcome for themselves with penalties for the rest by defecting from the group effort. In short, the risk of cooperating causes the cooperation to fail. Although I would expect this paper to advocate for the side of becoming or 'living up to' a superorganism, it seems to effectively accept defeat and propose reducing the number of agents and constraining the global decision space so as to reduce our superorganism's negative externalities:\n\n> Perhaps the biggest social trap of all is that we don\u2019t actually need all this energy and material stuff to be happy or healthy.\u00a0\n\nThere's something 'off' about this line to me. What if someone's happy and healthy life _does_ require \"all this energy and material stuff\"\u2014not just, e.g., people with disabilities or chronic illnesses with actual needs, but people who genuinely feel their lives are more significant because of their access to these further realms?\n\nI see that Section 9.1 includes a call for UBI but acknowledges what Friedman had feared about unchaining the money supply from gold without UBI: that the unchecked consumption of resources by the rich would devastate the rest and basically render the UBI pointless by its implementation.\n\nSection 9.2 includes this snappy line:\n\n> Finally, just as we discovered that we live in a heliocentric world, and that we evolved, we now begin to see that we are part of a biologically emergent Superorganism which is de-facto eating the planet.\n\nthough the rest of it made me wonder about the issues (not addressed here) of AI replacing labor and the energy and productivity trade-offs.\n\nSection 10 was a let-down! A bunch of rhetorical questions do not make an argument.\n\nSo, the solution proffered here is something like: cull the Superorganism back to a manageable size and curb \"unnecessaries\" (unnecessary to whom, however?) since, apparently, they can never lead to any Type 1 technologies that would obviate the problems raised in the article.... A recurring debate in the US and perhaps elsewhere is the value of (video) gaming, whether it does anything other than allegedly incite violence; yet I suspect some number of computer scientists today got into the field as a result of wanting to make a game of their own when they were young, whether that's what they do now or not. The reduction of \"unnecessaries\" is in any case always a political question with overtones of austerity economics, and as the video game example is meant to demonstrate, reduction of supposed unnecessaries and play can have its own unpredictable and adverse consequences. \n\nAnother solution to the Superorganism/Prisoners' Dilemma was sketched out by Vitalik Buterin in \"Superrationality and DAOs,\" https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/01/23/superrationality-daos, in which he argues that the Prisoner's Dilemma can be resolved, especially at scale, if there exists a means of ascertaining the _virtue_ of other participants. This is where the DAO becomes important, because the DAO's activities are on a public blockchain and its virtue\u2014its likelihood to defect and betray the group\u2014can be assessed in unprecedented forms, thus unlocking \"superrational\" coordinations of human activity and interests.\n\nOf course Buterin's piece is speculative (it's from _2015_), so it would be useful to pair it with perusal of a more recent statement, e.g., \"DAOs Are Not Corporations,\" https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/09/20/daos.html. I would prefer to understand corporations/companies as any organized or collective action at scale, often (but not always) via financial instruments, but Buterin mostly uses the term here to refer to for-profit, executive-led, C-corp types of corporation, or what he calls the authoritarian \"stereotypical large corporations.\" This may be a semantic squabble. In any case, Buterin notes:\n\n> Many of the more recent DAOs differ from earlier DAOs, like MakerDAO, in that whereas the earlier DAOs are organized around\u00a0providing infrastructure, the newer DAOs are organized around\u00a0performing various tasks around a particular theme.\u00a0\n\nThis contains the key development in the argument: the \"virtue\" of DAOs in \"Superrationality\" now becomes the \"credible fairness\" of DAOs in the engagement of some pursuits. This is at issue because DAOs do not simply resist nation-states, but may even take over functions of nation-states: thus they need to demonstrate credibility and credible fairness at levels commensurate with those being subsumed.\n\nFor Buterin, there are three meaningful ways to achieve credibility and demonstrate it, but only one is readily available for DAOs:\n\n> There are typically three ways of dealing with these types of corruption and insider trading issues:\n> \n> \u2014 Retroactively punish\u00a0malicious deciders.\n> \u2014 Proactively\u00a0filter for higher-quality\u00a0deciders.\n> \u2014 Add\u00a0more\u00a0deciders.\n> \n> The corporate world typically focuses on the first two, using financial surveillance and judicious penalties for the first and in-person interviews and background checks for the second. The decentralized world has less access to such tools: project tokens are likely to be tradeable anonymously, DAOs have at best limited recourse to external judicial systems, and the remote and online nature of the projects and the desire for global inclusivity makes it harder to do background checks and informal in-person \"smell tests\" for character. Hence, the decentralized world needs to put more weight on the third technique: distribute decision-making power among\u00a0more\u00a0deciders, so that each individual decider has less power, and so collusions are more likely to be whistleblown on and revealed.\n\nIn contrast to the Hagens article, Buterin envisions a solution to unchecked deleterious consumption through increasing participation rather than limiting it and removing 'unnecessaries.' I incline more towards Buterin's position although I recognize some of his idealism in just assuming sufficiently broad participation, thereby sidestepping the question of how participation becomes broad in the first place. For myself, I say that decentralization (like democracy) is a regulatory or legislative ideal rather than particular achievable states; in reality we are always dealing with representative systems and delegated authority\u2014and this isn't some evil that has to be stomped out, it's part of our condition as social creatures. If each person counts as an element in a set, then each group of people is a subset, and we know by the power law that there are always more subsets than elements of a set (in fact, there are 2^n more subsets than elements of a set of n elements). To return some earlier language here: Representation, or 'the symbolic' more broadly, necessarily suffuses the lives of beings which recognize themselves as beings of beings\u2014or even recognize themselves as beings of Being, if in a philosophical mood. <:feelsOldMan:1051281090784022670>\n\nAhem, **clears throat*, having gone through all that... I understand some of what you're saying here (\"I know some of those words!\") and the two questions you raise (about oracle security and more general oracle provenance, as I understand it) are indeed those of the Superorganism/DAO problem. The Hagens Superorganism solution might be to restrict unnecessaries and focus on quality sources; the Buterin DAO solution is to multiply sources to drown out bad quality. Yet I think Hagens is still correct to point out that some things, such as energy availability, cannot be drowned out or conjured away. But I'm not convinced that \"money is energy,\" nor even \"money is time\"\u2014one formula I find more intriguing is that money is \"frozen desire,\" a more plaintive formula is that money 'measures' the informational (rather than biophysical) economy. I'm not sure that any of this helps you, or that either Hagens or Buterin offer much help for your use-case dealing with particular kinds of data and data sources, but it is always interesting to me to see how people are responding to these design challenges. Unfortunately I don't really know anything about code or programming (at the moment); most of my abilities/interactions in the space so far are constrained to providing descriptions or redescriptions of some systems and ideas in what I hope are clarifying or at least interesting terms to help others work through their own questions. Who knows though\u2014maybe 2023 will be the year I finally learn All The Stuff. <:PES2_EvilPlan:888440873568854016>\n\n<@503057962852548608> thank you for this excellent essay response. i found your points about money and energy's relationship excellent, as well as your discussion of language. i put together a PDF of this while reading for anyone who wants to read this but gets lost on the Discord thread.\n\n<@753720709032968213> / <@612373403864924196> math bigbrains, could you help me understand the function notation used in this paragraph for the _social choice function_? what is that saying in english?\n\nI might be missing something, but it seems to be a convoluted way of saying that, given C an unordered set of candidates, a _voting system_ function f maps the Sm set of permutations of C (i.e., ballots) in such a way that it yields a new set C with ordering, ostensibly matching the ballot ranking of candidates.

What follows are just preliminary notes with some general thoughts in relation to designing DAOs, which I'd normally keep to my research journal, but I thought typing them up might have some tangential interest to someone here:\n\nRavaisson argues (_pace_ and proleptically to Bergson) that habit\u2014which demands repetition, stereotypy, discipline\u2014paradoxically _suffuses the body with freedom._ I might even say habit introduces a second-order freedom: a freedom not only to perform certain actions, but to perform them _more or less well,_ i.e., to artfully or virtuously (as in: virtuoso) perform actions. (For more on virtue/virtuosity, consult Paolo Virno's essay \"Virtuosity and Revolution: The Political Theory of Exodus,\" which appears here:\u00a0https://www.generation-online.org/c/fcmultitude2.html\u00a0but has also been slightly updated/revised for his recent collection _The Idea of World_.)\n\nOne of the major insights of psychoanalysis\u2014which, as Deleuze correctly notes, refers to habit/homeostasis as \"pleasure principle\"\u2014is that in the living/organic being, or at least in human beings, there is some motor \"beyond the pleasure principle\" (i.e. beyond habit), something which (as Lacan will later explain) shears or splits pleasure from satisfaction, such that humans are capable of finding satisfaction in their own misery and unpleasure.\u00a0\n\nFreud somewhat controversially calls this motor \"the death drive,\" but it is actually a profoundly creative force as well: it makes possible human engagement beyond the limits of 'economic sense,' fomenting our work in arts, sciences, politics, and beyond. So the point is not about eliminating this \"death drive,\" which would paradoxically drain human reality of its life. But there is no denying that people often show up in analysis precisely when they (or, sometimes, their friends or family) have recognized this miserable satisfaction as counter to their flourishing.\u00a0\n\nOne job of analysis is therefore to put the harness of desire back on unruly satisfaction. It is only by targeting this deeper motor (i.e., death drive) that one has a chance of meaningfully changing (or changing one's second-order relation to) one's habits\u2014hence not only of what actions one performs, but of performing one's existing repertoire of actions more or less \"well,\" i.e., more or less in conformity with one's desire. At the same time, the death drive also means that all habit and all pleasure is split from within, and thus that living bodies will never be able to cultivate perfect habits, and living bodies themselves will never be perfectible.\u00a0\n\nHuman reality, our life in common, is therefore split, riven between (i) our use of words which say more and less than we mean, and (ii) the umbral tide of satisfactions which we do not want. (The 'living our' or embodiment of this split might be a candidate description for human sexuality.)\n\nWhat has any of this to do with designing DAOs? If a system is supposed to be decentralized and public, then it should take care to observe human nature so as not to pointlessly repress behaviors but to cultivate the interface between system and members.\n\nSome have argued\u2014such as Vitalik Buterin\u2014that mere transparency or publicity are sufficient to overcome the 'corrupting' or colluding forces that can arise in an organization, cf:\n\n> Hence, the decentralized world needs to put more weight on the third technique: distribute decision-making power among\u00a0more\u00a0deciders, so that each individual decider has less power, and so collusions are more likely to be whistleblown on and revealed. (\"DAOs are not corporations,\"\u00a0https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/09/20/daos.html)\n\nThis is consistent with Buterin's overall position on lying and deception, which draws from machine learning research to make claims about human cognition\u2014to wit, Buterin says that it is hard to 'fake' your position or consciously lie to others, on the basis that two processes happening concurrently on a PC makes the PC slower and more error-prone: _mutatis mutandi_ for humans running two competing computational or emotional processes (greed inside, virtuous altruism outside).\n\nIt's legitimate to want to question and put pressure on the use of machine learning results to frame human cognition, but for a psychoanalytically informed view of human being, there's something quite right about Buterin's formulation, if not the final destination or peregrinations of the intervening argument: Freud himself specifies that human cognition is marked or split by two parallel and coeval processes, which he called Primary (the unconscious) and Secondary (consciousness). Freud noted, as Buterin does, that these parallel processes indeed give rise to quite wild varieties of error and inefficiency\u00a0in human reality and human institutions.\n\nAnother source of pressure on Buterin's democratic ideals comes directly from anti-democratic republicans (I'm not referring to the US GOP/DNC political parties) who variously portray the public as a noisy, mad, unwashed, uneducated, irrational, emotional, possibly communist (or otherwise revolutionary) \"mob.\" I note in passing that these adjectives were\u2014and still are\u2014often applied to those in suffrage and freedom movements. An especially zesty anti-democrat might throw down a gauntlet such as: Should the nuclear reactors be staffed by public election, or even via chance appointment of public members?\u00a0Here one might wish to object that technology operations and political decision-making are separate realms, but that response begs the question, especially in light of today's scandals over large social media/technology organization's content moderation policies and the impact on political processes. Something deeper is therefore needed.\n\nWhat a psychoanalytic understanding of human being can provide is a corrective against both republican and democratic tendencies to exaggerate and romanticize human nature, either that of experts or the common person.\n\nIn the first place, I will note as I often do that democracy is what philosophers would call a regulatory or legislative ideal\u2014some argue the ultimate democracy, or equality of all in death, is the very ground of politics as such, the fatal calculus to which one recurs in deciding whether to obey or rebel (\"Give me liberty or give me death!\")\u2014and not a specifically realizable state or political form.\u00a0\n\nWhat would \"democracy\" look like, anyway? It is known that the political body in Attic democracy was not formed by public elections but by a \"drawing of lots\" (essentially, by raffle or a dice toss), combined with remarkably short terms of service from six to twelve months. Is this _more or less_ democratic than the systems of many elected parliamentary democracies today? The fact that democracies can only ever be described as _more or less_ democratic indicates that the formation of a political democracy is always a \"second-order\" action, one that in some sense always re-performs the ultimate democracy[1] of politics as such.\n\n|| > 1. But is \"the ultimate democracy\" really that of Death? This was Hegel's position: the Master-Slave or Lord-Bondsman dialectic only gives way at the brink of death, when one pulls back and each \"recognize\" the authority or submission of the other. This combat-oriented vision of dialectic (and politics in general) may however be rather partial or inadequate, since there are many claims for recognition which are not concluded by violent struggle, not even by proxy or 'at the limit,' as might be said. That is to say, there very much exist life-and-death consequences to many political struggles, but it is clearly not the case that all such struggles are terminated by life-or-death ultimatums, even by proxy or 'at the limit' (whatever that would mean). Perhaps there is therefore another 'ultimate democracy' to which humans appeal. (Even better in my opinion, more accurate to say: democracy ruins the ultimate, by 'imaging' the ultimate itself.) Jacques Ranci\u00e8re has argued that this democracy is the democracy of the Intelligence: any meaningfully known or understood concept, no matter how rarefied or abstruse its content, must still be graspable by others. Indeed, before the \"equality of death\" which apparently governs the dialectical process of history, there must be some \"equality of understandings\" of the meaning of recognition, otherwise the struggle to death would always and everywhere prevail. Let us put it this way: Democracy as a political form or ideal appears to us as always-already _re-performed_, _encore_ (and _en corps_), first as Death, then as Intelligence. ||\n\nWhen humans bind themselves together in an organization of any sort\u2014that is, when they form a new image of life together\u2014they create or introduce into the world a second-order to their actions: now they not only perform this or that action, but they perform actions more or less well, that is, more or less in accord with their organization's image of life in common.\n\nEmerson's proviso in the epigraph to these notes can be taken as a corrective to the twin tendencies/temptations of democrats and republicans (again, not the US parties) with respect to democracy. That is, the democratic exaggeration might see in democracy a direct \"doubling\" of the lives of the political community, hence entirely absolving the need for representative structures, whereas the republican exaggeration sees in democracy inefficient and incompetent \"divisions\" of life and power.\n\nWhat I'm calling a psychoanalytic understanding of human being or human nature helps to check these tendencies and orient our political thinking along lines that cultivate flourishing over punishing waywardness, where possible, by furnishing an \"image of life\" that captures or corresponds to what is \"living\" in human life, i.e., desire.\n\nTo the republican nightmare of unruly mobs, psychoanalysis attests to the following fact: _every person thinks,_ every person is thinking about their lives. But even among groups of experts, there exists an opacity of consciousness to itself\u2014Freud called it the unconscious, but I've presented it above in terms of the splitting of pleasure and satisfaction, habit (homeostasis) and death drive. This fundamental opacity means that even groups of trained experts are susceptible to groupthink and 'corruption,' even in the absence of incentives or coercive measures for such.\n\nThis has to do with the \"scaling\" of human organizations. This scaling is never additive but multiplicative, and this multiplication can be (and probably often is) fractional, rarely a whole number. This is why we often find in democratic organizations (or in organizations that optimize for member\u00a0governance: \"of the people, by the people, for the people\") \"fractalized\" patterns of governance and control. (For more on this, check out Benoit Mandelbrot's _The Misbehavior of Markets_, which lays out many of his important insights on human organizations as fractional or fractal systems.)\u00a0Perhaps this is most evident in the experiment of the United States, with its national legislature, state legislatures, etc., followed by federal courts, state courts, etc., followed by national executive, state executives, etc. This \"nesting\" or fractalized system of governance may only be weakly to moderately ergodic\u2014this is often cited in the republicans' complaints: democracies have too much disorder, discord, and dissensus among their levels to govern effectively and decisively\u2014but the non-ergodicity of these structures may in fact be their most salient political value, since this is what guarantees their functional oversight of each other and the capacity to evolve in relation to a community.\n\nTo the democratic dream of total participation or perfect representation (which coincides with non-representation), psychoanalysis provides the following reminder: _every person enjoys,_ and enjoyment (or satisfaction) disturbs the habits of body and mind you wish to perfect. Here a deeper detour into psychoanalysis can be instructive (see also Slavoj Zizek\u2019s _For They Know Not What They Do: Enjoyment as a Political Factor_). Where, after all, does enjoyment (either as opposed to pleasure, or as surplus-pleasure) come from? It comes from the 'symbolic' operations in infantile life: not only does milk satisfy the infant's hunger, but a symbolic excess attaches to the act of feeding, such that, e.g., the suckling action at the bottle or breast, the way you're held, or the sounds in the background can all become obscure points of fixation and surplus-pleasure or enjoyment. The infant is induced into symbolic operations because of our species' premature birth and chronic neoteny, or what Freud calls the \"radical helplessness\" (_Hilflosigkeit_) of the human being, our dependence on a parent/neighbor/helper.\u00a0\n\nThis disturbance of\u00a0surplus-pleasure mandates a quota of representational or symbolic operation because the infant cannot contain or \"bind\" all of its pleasure in physical processes. Thus commences the child's slow crawl toward the acquisition of language, the negation-fueled fantasies of puberty, and the allegedly \"adult\" world of reason. When humans come together in an organization, they are still individually guided by the contingencies in their development.\n\nHere comes finally my big idea or proposition:\u00a0DAOs\u2014successful public DAOs, anyway, like other successful public institutions\u2014must be able to achieve or facilitate something like a 'psychoanalysis' of their members, in order for those members to evaluate their actions in terms of the organization's image of a common life.\n\nIn many cases, especially where organizational membership is voluntary and the scope of activities is somewhat restricted, this process is often already done (if imperfectly) by society: one's enjoyments already attune one to \"becoming,\" say, a mathematician or Democrat.\n\nBut for DAOs that cannot readily count on members who've been similarly socialized and/or for DAOs with scopes of action that may be large, variable, or cross multiple specializations, how they on-board new members and facilitate adoption will be of some consequence, especially when decisions are made by vote.\n\nOne solution for DAOs may be to set up a \"bootcamp\" or \"orientation\" process for new members. The wisdom of this solution is ancient; Machiavelli would take it for granted that one can convert the ethical habits of individuals into the broader \u00a0_customs_ of a society, which themselves, when sufficiently coherent and organized, can become a _state._\n\nThe purpose of linking DAOs to psychoanalysis is that DAOs, like analysis, can powerfully disrupt and reconfigure the transitions between habits, customs, and states\u2014they are capable of reaching \"beyond the pleasure principle,\" that is, beyond the sickly homeostasis of financialization.\u00a0\n\nYet DAOs can only do this by being mindful of their representational excesses (i.e., their representative/organizational structure), and especially of being mindful of the uneven representational excesses that a decentralized membership\u00a0brings with it. Developing ways for DAOs to operate _through_ the ambiguity of differences of opinion and contradictory priorities\u2014put differently: for DAOs to _listen_ to their members, even when members barely speak the same language or are of patently different socializations\u2014through thoughtful governance designs, uniquely possible on blockchain, will be crucial to DAOs' survival as public institutions and will determine how DAOs challenge existing public institutions to reform. That is, if DAOs (and crypto more generally) introduce new digital freedoms to the (physical or political) body, many of which are still barely understood and little articulated, they will have to possess some means of addressing the unruly motor of human motivation to properly \"suffuse\" this freedom throughout the body. This is why novel or refined voting systems and governance/decision-making processes are key to the DAO concept, if not its hallmarks.\n\nthis is a cool point. i think <@753720709032968213> has shared before papers about designing systems explicitly for conflict that i am reminded of from this\n\nAlso in connection to this point is the historian of science Georges Canguilhem's argument that the \"health\" of an organism is not its fixity to a norm, as though sickness were the fall from or a lack of a norm\u2014in fact, sicknesses very often establish their own homeostatic equilibrium. Canguilhem thus says that the health of an organism should be defined as its capacity to establish new norms, rather than its adherence to one.\n\nOne point I plan to develop further: what is the relation between organ, organism, and organization? How does life enter or filter out of these entities? To read on this front: Pierre Klossowski's _Living Currency_ and Michael Marder's _Hegel's Energy_, both somewhat philosophical takes on biological or libidinal energetics and social economics.\n\nAlston has written about \"governance through conflict\": https://law.mit.edu/pub/governanceasconflict/release/1\n\nThere's something about the definition of \"shared values\" as the ground of an organization or group that sticks out to me as needing some (or maybe a lot of) scrutiny, but it doesn't make much difference within Alston's argument at large. \n\nBut in response to the claim that \"sufficiently shared values lead to a common purpose that constitutes an organization,\" I would say that values are rarely the sole or main criteria for membership in a group/organization. Moreover, a common purpose can be defined independently of shared values, although shared values may indeed contribute greatly to the legitimacy and long-term acceptance of this purpose. In fact, the common purpose can determine the shared values, rather than the reverse. For example I think it would be difficult to determine the \"shared values\" of a citizenry in a way that would be prior to or constitutive of their purpose (survival).\n\nBeing able to define and use shared values to navigate conflict is a powerful governance tool\u2014hence the importance of an organization's Constitutional design\u2014but there may still be an outstanding question of how to navigate _conflicting values_ under a shared purpose. Or this may just be terminological, I haven't decided.\n\nThinking a little more about it... Alston might say navigation of a conflict of values would need to be channeled through an organization's/constitution's amendment process. <a:hmmPizza:1050825992609988609>\n\nOnce again I am going to have Eric read these thoughts. He\u2019s going to be thrilled! I\u2019m at a conf with him this weekend in Berkeley.\n\nDo you perchance know if he works with DAOs only on commission? At NetaDAO we're nearing the end of our Operating Agreement/Constitution deliberations, though I still need to write up the subDAO articles and some other important odds and ends. We'll be looking for external reviewers and very probably an attorney to go over the details (attorney can add all the whatever legal verbiage).\n\nI can ask!\n\nre: \"shared values\" as the ground of an organization, Ranci\u00e8re says: \"One could say that the existence of politics is always conflictual, and never based on anything like consensual organization or delegation. We live under regimes that purport to be regimes of consensual delegation, but in reality what we call 'politics' is a conflict between two antagonistic principles\" (_Politics and Aesthetics_, 28). So the limit of shared values as an organizational ground might be those organizations that are 'political' (political _rather than what?_ perhaps rather than for-profit?).\n\nhttps://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rubin-Democracy.pdf\n\n\"A Theory of Democracy for the Administrative State\" by Edward Rubin (wip) -- some very interesting overall thoughts and historical interventions on organizational life and governance... has some nice tie-ins with Rubin's book _State, Soul, and Society_ that looks at how modern states developed alongside a modern ethos of self-fulfillment and individual liberty (today somewhat discredited or otherwise distanced by 'postmodern' emphases on pastiche and copying, irony and anxiety, etc.).\n\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/2095101 \n\nthis is a classic paper that argues \"institutional isomorphism\" (institutiones that look like each other) find it easier to interact.\n\ni've argued that DAO DAO makes it easier to confederate (https://www.else.how/p/mondragon-lessons-for-dao-dao). this paper gives me some better language to talk about this thesis. \"the iron cage revisited\" talks about isomorphism inside the organization - DAO DAO is about isomorphism at the organization's *edges* - purchase orders, payroll, and other things that have no trans-institutional representation today are given trans-institutional representation on-chain by DAO DAO and the primitives it picks. \n\noverall, this paper gives me hope that a bit of DAO DAO adoption can start a 'flywheel' - organizations that use DAO DAO will find it easier to work with other organizations that use DAO DAO.\n\noooo\n\nThanks for sharing this! I wonder if institutional isomorphism is related to what I think of as the inevitability of organizational fractalization.\u00a0Benoit Mandelbrot would ask: Why do rivers look like tree branches, and the veins of tree leaves look like rivers? But we can just as well ask: Why do governments have 'national' or top-level forms that tend to be replicated (in structure or form, though typically not in scope or purpose) downward\u2014presidents, governors, mayors... Supreme Court, circuit court, state court, county court, city court... and so on?\n\nPerhaps any organization of \"power,\" be it biological, social, militaristic, economic, etc., tends to roughly recapitulate itself beyond a certain scale. This non-ergodic roughness/fractalization would then be something like the texture of \"life itself.\" Hence these two aspects or axes\u2014non-ergodicity and roughness/fractalization, or inaccurate replication\u2014generate life's surprising variation and homogeneity. (Leo Bersani:\u00a0\"We exist, in both time and space, in a vast network of *near-sameness,* a network characterized by relations of inaccurate replication. Accurate replication\u2014the perfect identity of terms\u2014is an attempted human correction of these correspondences, a fantasy of specularity in the place of correspondence.\")\n\nI will note: the term \"isomorphism\" here surprised me, since my academic work began in mathematics and I still reserve \"isomorphism\" for one-to-one structure-preserving maps/functions; the use here is\u00a0\n\n> a constraining process that forces one unit in population to resemble other units that face the same set of environmental conditions.\n\nTherefore I think another potential candidate for describing or contextualizing this process of inaccurate replication, given the emphasis on organizations responding to their \"environment,\" could be Darwinian \"selection\"[1]\u2014tho I want to shy away from unqualified/naive analogies between the organic and the organizational. For me, this space \"between\" the organic and the organizational corresponds to the space \"between\" the physical and the symbolic, the natural and the cultural: the point is not to permanently segregate them, nor to proclaim them as all and one, but to grapple with their emulsive immiscibilities.\n\nYou write:\u00a0\"DAO DAO is about isomorphism at the organization's edges - purchase orders, payroll, and other things that have no trans-institutional representation today are given trans-institutional representation on-chain by DAO DAO and the primitives it picks.\"\n\nThis seems to me a way of saying that DaoDao unlocks new 'environmental' possibilities for institutional/organizational life, new centers and peripheries of power and resistance, new schemes for representational techniques. It may be as hard for us to forecast the development and uses of these representational powers as it would have been for the first speakers of language to predict Marcel Proust, but I think you are eminently correct that DaoDao is capable of starting a \"flywheel\" of organizational usage, adoption, and change.\n\nIn 2015, Buterin speculated that DAOs will facilitate the formation of \"superrational\" organisms/organizations that, via their public ledgers, will replace credentialized systems of trust and punishment with measurable \"virtue\" and enticements to further virtuous/virtuoso performances. Whether this was overly optimistic or naive, the possibility to use blockchain to reform the life of institutions is closer today than ever before thanks to the work of DaoDao and its contributors, and it's why I'm glad to have NetaDAO as a place to really experiment with the idea of a public institution for the Interchain. <a:dance:1035704193891188836>\n\n1. To be sure, even within Darwinian theory, there are those who completely neglect that his theory of \"selection\" is internally split, i.e., between natural and sexual selection. Sexual selection produces 'apparently' unnecessary and even counter-to-survival results\u2014think of the peacock's feathers\u2014without which however survival would risk becoming flat and meaningless, or anyway much less libidinally satisfying. One could approach this from Hegel's observation that the rational concept of \"bird\" necessitates only one kind, whereas reality abounds with birds upon birds\u2014thus something in natural\u00a0being, or life, manifestly distorts and/or fails to correspond to the logic of rational/economic efficacy, or mere survival.\u00a0\n\nThis variety and multiplicity of the natural, or life, suppurates\u00a0the sameness of rationality. No doubt this fact was at the base of the ancient intuition held by Heraklitus and others that \"Nature encrypts itself,\" or more literally: nature\u00a0_loves_ encryption, nature loves to hide. With some libations, or in an especially speculative mood, I might claim that what nature fundamentally encrypts is the social itself, i.e., the social life of plants and animals and the deep mysteries of speciation.\n\nThe real mystery of organizational life might lie in how shared purpose nevertheless accommodates and gives rise to discrepant values. I think of such organizations as the school, where teachers are in principle all committed to providing the best education for students, yet can have various and even opposed values on how that's best achieved. Navigating the discrepancy or conflict of values is really the core of governance in these cases, and I think I would be more persuaded that organizations _invent and compel_ shared values in response to crises, rather than drawing upon them, and that the possibilities of scope and scale for this creative and coercive action is determinative of organizational life.\n\nThis would correspond to Jean-Luc Nancy's argument in _The Truth of Democracy_ (https://www.oddweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Nancy-The-Truth-of-Democracy.pdf) that the true \"common\" is not a blanket under which \"we all\" shelter\u2014some property we all hold in common\u2014but _a blank_ which stubbornly eludes us and which we all must ultimately fill in for ourselves.\n\nhttps://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003331780-4/law-unto-peter-hallward\n\n> As its usage in compounds like automation and autocracy also suggests, the \u2018auto\u2019 or \u2018self\u2019 of autonomy is ambiguous, and helps to mark the concept off from related notions of freedom and independence. What kind of actor can freely lay down a law for itself, a law in the strict, universal and commanding sense of the term? Who is the self of self-legislation? Without wanting to delve too deeply into the canonical history of European philosophy here, I think Kant\u2019s famous and uncompromising answer to this question helpfully foregrounds its conscious and voluntarist dimensions, but it unhelpfully abstracts the moral actor from all constitutive social relations, investing it in pure practical reason. Hegel\u2019s rejoinder to Kant certainly recovers the relational and plural quality of a political actor, but also diminishes its capacity to act, and to legislate, by dispersing it across the general spirit that both animates a legitimate state and \u2018disposes\u2019 its members in a law-abiding hierarchy. Rousseau\u2019s emphasis on popular sovereignty and participatory law-making, by contrast, helps clarify what\u2019s at stake in the ongoing struggle for autonomy, a struggle understood as an essentially collective effort that pits a mass community of equals against any kind of domineering elite.\n\n\n\n<:pog:1034269207594020864>\n\nEnjoying this so far. I would say that they present \"institutional analysis\" in the same way I was thinking that DAOs could psychoanalyze the social, i.e., by revealing their latent or 'unconscious' mechanisms of action: \"The problem with this way of looking at the issue of rural land conflicts in Brazil [i.e., as a deficit of revolutionary political will] is that it focuses on the upfront manifestations of the actions of players, but does not consider the institutional foundations that determine the players' incentives and constraints\" (5). \n\nAlston et al eschew non-institutional analyses for getting caught up in symptoms of social disorder and ignoring their common cause, e.g., in Brazil, the federal branch is empowered to redistribute land to the landless, but the judiciary's scope is simply to enforce legislation (property right)\u2014so the endless conflict over land comes from the authorization of two public institutions of authority whose relations are not 'properly' or fully delineated. Now some might read that inconsistency as cynical gamesmanship, \"the conspiracy of capitalists\" as it were, but this hardly explains why other countries that are even more capitalistic are not also plunged into perpetual broad-scale land disputes.\n\nhttps://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/06/when-new-york-city-really-was-run-from-a-smoke-filled-room.html\n\nHi from New York!

(Zargam's basement)\n\nyou are a maniac\n\n<@755585146140491956> i'm finding this video series to be extremely helpful in transitioning the paper to something practical: https://youtu.be/8t-FKDzrnmA\n\nthis slide is wildly cool\n\nlike, this is all reasonably intuitive, but i LOVE this framing of the problem\n\non to part three next lol\n\n<@753720709032968213> / <@755585146140491956> wanna meet up next week and try to make a little GDS and model it?\n\ncool, will give it a watch\n\nabsolutely, i'm quite free\n\nwe can come up with a toy problem or try to constrain something with our contracts.\n\nnice!\n\none idea I have is to try and extend their AMM analysis with RAW DAO's fee split mechanism\n\nthough that depends on having a copy of the second paper in their series that does not appear to be published yet\n\nthough, i also hear <@753720709032968213> is in the basement ;)\n\nyeah, if we could get a preprint we could even contribute to the paper before it comes out\n\n(if we find something interesting)\n\n<@676640406875930644> i think you should feel empowered to email the authors on any paper and ask for a preprint. you can flatter them and explain your project idea\n\npapers have email addresses in the affiliation exactly for people like you to do this\n\nthe fact that other established scholars also use those emails to contact paper authors (usually to nitpick about some parochial concern) is an unfortunate but unavoidable side effect\n\nyes and yes -- I can ask mz\n\nanother way of sating this is `x' =f(x,u)` where `x` belongs to the space `X` and `u` belongs to `Ux`. The \"big X\" is the \"statespace\" and the `Ux` is what we can call the admissible inputs -- if you think of those inputs as \"actions\" its like saying these `Ux` is all the actions that are possible (or allowed to be taken) when the current state of the system is `x`. In this notation `x'` is the new point that you land in if you were at `x` then the admissible action `u` was taken.\n\nthis is a pretty abstract construction but one implementation is calling a method on a smart contract.  `X` is the data structure in the smart contract and `x` is the current value of that struct. Given the current value there are many possible valid transactions `Ux`,  and we choose exactly one of them `u` when you execute that transaction -- then afterward the smart contract struct is in state `x'`\n\n<@676640406875930644> if you're around for chat - anytime\n\n<@755585146140491956> <@676640406875930644> when free for zargham call?\n\nlike -- sunday or monday anytime\n\nSunday (tomorrow) would work great for me!\n\nalso, sent an email asking for part II\n\nso now we wait with crossed fingers\n\nYAY\n\nUHHH hahaha Z says \"we're getting together at oxford (November) to write part II!:\"\n\naha monday also works great :)\n\nor tuesday\n\ni'm just going to remain on vacation until i feel like i've learned this stuff\n\nso >= wednesday also works :)\n\nYAY\n\nokay - free tomorrow and also now lol\n\nthink i want to figure out the crosswalk example before we try one ourselves\n\nstill working through part III of the videos\n\nso ideally after that\n\ni.e. tomorrow :)\n\nyay perfect tomorow let me know when, lololol\n\nThrilled you're into this\n\nQUITE\n\nvery glad you and nick introduced me!\n\nstill not sure if it will work for us, but WAY more promising than any other formal verification technique for these things than I have seen before\n\nYAY yes yes\n\nright?

I think we (DAO DAO) find ourselves asking similar questions to the ones that probably motivated this work - how can we run a business that operates a lot like SaaS without extracting rent from our customers? How can we come up with some objective function to maximize, but whose maximization should not become socially or ecologically deleterious?\n\nQuestions I asked: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12KAzuwEtN1NkRQZC1sRJJdbA684ytE3ggXAVdZdrLT8/edit\n\nDoing this now!

I think there are a lot of learnings we can apply to our own systems\n\n<@898769611200274482> Can I use this for the episode NOTES!??!!?

Getting better at this!\n\nquick recap of meeting with <@451859116961300501> : we're going to proceed with installing the telescope bot in our server, unless anyone has any issues with this (but from previous discussions, people have seemed to support it.) The way you interact with the bot is by emoji-tagging certain posts that you believe should be flagged for ethnographic research, but we need to be intentional about what kinds of posts we want to tell everyone to tag (what questions are we trying to ask about our governance? what are we trying to discover?). We can discuss this more in the upcoming community call.\n\nno worries!\n\nDAOchem: DAOchem is a mixture of on- and off-chain governance data sources which react to produce a holistic view of DAO governance produced by Lucia Korpas with an ETH Denver hackathon team (Sage Shelton, Son Nguyen, and stryker). We are working to integrate data on smart contract parameters, voting activity, Twitter activity, and contributor sentiment to help DAO creators, contributors and researchers understand the governance landscape\nhttps://daogovdata.info/\n\nAn overarching question driving our work is: are DAOs \"working\" right now? Are they what they say they are? Are they achieving their stated goals? How do DAO contributors feel about their experiences? To answer these questions, we're less interested in the nitty-gritty operational details specific to each DAO and more in patterns of governance structures and behaviors that might be observed across DAOs. In particular:\n\nWhat governance systems are DAO founders choosing to implement, with what \"laws\"?\nIn what (measurable) ways are DAO members participating in governance? Does DAO member activity relate to the chosen systems?\nHow satisfied are DAO members with their own experiences and with the health/success of the DAO overall? How do these experiences relate to the chosen systems?\n\nHi, I'll try to answer this for NetaDAO since it's 'sort of' my wing, but I leave this all open for other NetaDAO members to add to/correct me on.\n\n1. Are DAOs \"working\" right now?\nWe are working and right now we are forming a legal entity for the DAO since the DAO is engaged in partnerships of selling NFTs, which will involve the DAO in tax events that need clear jurisdiction. We hope to have the LLC established by January.\n\n2. Are DAOs what they say they are?\nI can't speak for others, but imo, NetaDAO is a true DAO: the people building around NETA are from all over the world and united by NETA drop. Nobody has centrally organized or planned growth or membership, and we don't want to do so going forward. NetaDAO should remain a proto-DAO, grassroots and bottom-up.  \n\n3. What governance systems are DAO founders choosing to implement, with what \"laws\"?\nDue to regulatory concerns, we are considering a \"law\" that members cannot have more than 10% control of NetaDAO's voting power, with a contract(?) that automatically limits members' stake if they exceed the cap. (This doesn't solve a sybil attack, but it solves the regulatory concern for now). Perhaps the other major \"law\" of NetaDAO is that, as a nonprofit, it will not distribute revenue to stakers. (We are researching setting up a for-profit entity that might have this capability, but time will tell.)\n\nIn thinking about NetaDAO's organizational structure, I have been looking to hybridize traditional business, university, and political party structures that are relevant, with an eye (as mentioned) toward respecting growth and enabling members to get involved. Right now we have drafted a handful of Verticals with subDAOs under each, and the subDAOs are comprised of (at least) tech leads, support, and advisory/public oversight roles (i.e., nontechnical but interested members from NetaDAO community).\n\n4. In what (measurable) ways are DAO members participating in governance? Does DAO member activity relate to the chosen system?\nNobody has put up a spam proposal so far, so I think our proposal deposit is at least high enough. We will have our first real governance activity when we try to ratify the NetaDAO Operating Agreement.\n\n5. How satisfied are DAO members with their own experiences and with the health/success of the DAO overall? How do these experiences relate to the chosen systems?\nI don't have any data on this one, but I hope (and believe) that members who have attended the weekly meetings have felt welcomed and able to contribute. I know that two people have volunteered to work on business/tax/legal issues with me, and I believe that there is a general interest to get involved in a DAO really trying to experiment and explore what a DAO can be and do.\n\nWow!

Participatory DAOs are managed by distributed consensus through smart contracts to signal the preferences of members. Algorithmic DAOs aim to be entirely algorithmically governed, with the underlying smart contracts dictating the entire functionality of a DAO.\n\nAn example of a participatory DAO might be GitcoinDAO, which has a council of governors, which can allocate governance tokens to stewards, deliberates proposals on forums, votes on \u201cSnapshot\u201d (an \u201coff-chain\u201d voting tool), and then executed voted proposals, such as allocating funds. An example of an algorithmic DAO is DxDAO, which launched with no pre-defined members, and is completely community run without any intervention of a project or team, which controls a decentralised trading protocol and other DeFi tools. The aim of DxDAO, as well as other DAOs which may define themselves as \u201calgorithmic\u201d, is to be \u201cas widely distributed as possible from day one\u201d.\n\nYet, all DAOs are both participatory and algorithmic. This is what is unique about DAOs. DAOs require participation, which is a political process where the actors involved in decision-making processes are positioned towards each other through power relationships that occurs \u201coff-chain\u201d, and algorithmic governance, which is the point at which decisions are reflected", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": {"channel": 1032788394893398026}, "index": 1, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "a46cc6b3-f29e-4990-8a0c-ec9c6a57c3ce", "node_info": {"start": 12439, "end": 25318}}, {"text": "as allocating funds.

DAOs require participation, which is a political process where the actors involved in decision-making processes are positioned towards each other through power relationships that occurs \u201coff-chain\u201d, and algorithmic governance, which is the point at which decisions are reflected and executed \u201con-chain\u201d through the use of smart contracts.\n\nDefining resilience in DAOs\n\n\u201cActs in a decentralized decision-making system will be denoted resilient if it ensures all decisions made in the DAO to agree with its approximate opinion\u201d\n\nWithout a stated purpose, and engaged participants, measures for resilience and \u2018success\u2019 are unclear. Thus, a resilient is one that acts in line with its own mission and governance purpose.\n\nI am filling out this telescope bot consent form on behalf of DAO DAO, given we have gathered consent at last week's community call\n\n\n\nhey <@755585146140491956> just checking, all of our discord channels are visible to the public right? it's just that posting to certain channels are role-gated?\n\n(wondering because the telescope bot instructions say that the channel where the tagged messages appear should be public)\n\ngood q. all channels are visible except contributor-hub, which requires the DF-given contributor tag. the rest are public as long as you select the relevant react emoji in <#1037837947002703902>\n\nthis is all up for ongoing discussion\n\nhmm okay\n\nwell I didn't want telescope to violate the visibility of hidden channels\n\nI can also see the reasoning for making contributor-hub hidden to non-contributors\n\nat the same time, I think the bot should be able to include messages from contributor hub channels as those could be valuable -- so I will ask them if it is possible to make the bot post on a contributor-gated channel\n\nok, the telescope bot has been set up!\n\nthe flow works like this: tag messages you want to curate with the telescope emoji (\ud83d\udd2d) and it will appear in a special channel on the researchers' discord to be approved for curation. once they approve it, the bot DMs the author of the message to get consent. once the author approves the curation, the message will show up in the contributor hub <#1041816219403178124> channel. (side note: the bot has contributor perms and only contributors can see the telescope-bridge channel.)\n\nnow gonna reach out to ellie to see if we can schedule a meeting this week to talk about how to think about this research and message tagging!\n\nawesome!\n\ndo you have any guidelines / thoughts about what sorts of messages we should be tagging like this?\n\nanswering that question will be the goal of our call with Ellie!\n\naha you are one step ahead\n\n<@753720709032968213> <@755585146140491956> <@181607258512162816> <@676640406875930644> (and anyone else who wants to join) does Thursday 3pm PT or 4pm PT work for you to call with Ellie?\n\nboth work for me :)\n\nSend invite!\n\ncreated an event for thursday at 3pm PT! zoom link is in the description\n\nhere is the invite link to the metaeth discord!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/9hCWcBf9\n\nyou'll see a \"dao dao\" section in there. messages which have been curated will pop up, and we can click \"request\"\n\n(the \"request\" then sends a DM to the message author to consent, then finally the message will show up in telescope-bridge)\n\nreminder that the chat with Ellie is today at 3 PT! zoom link in event description\n\nhttps://www.crowdwrite.xyz/metagov/cl7e9sjvc000q09jx9kjhbocz/text\n\n<@898769611200274482> in about an hour, yes?\n\nfor the gov experience event?

Data Driven Economic Systems\nCryptoeconomic systems provide near real-time data of on-chain economic activities, and may govern access\nrights or provide proofs related to data stored off-chain. The advancement in machine learning and system identification methods over the past decade has increased our capacity for creating novel, useful models in across a wide\nrange of applications [Jordan and Mitchell 2015], and in the context of economics [Mullainathan and Spiess 2017]\nin particular. This, for the first time, allows for almost real time steering of these economies and a level of applied\ncybernetics that was not possible before. Furthermore, it increases the precision of modeling and measurement\nrequired for steering these economies. This results in a data driven regulatory process, as shown in Figure 5.\nHowever, the advances of machine learned models [Jordan and Mitchell 2015] is a consequence of the growth\nof the digital economy that captures a large amount of economic data. This data is largely controlled by large\ntech firms operating platform based services which are often subject to algorithmic bias [Garcia 2016], [Lewis\nand Westlund 2015],[S\u00e6tra 2019], [Von Foerster 2003]. The stateful nature of cryptoeconomic systems has the\npotential to cede control over data back to the users of these platforms, if privacy by design is considered in the\nmodeling of the cryptoeconomic systems and their applications [Voshmgir 2019a].\n\nhttps://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e\n\nhere's another essay that I found to be really nice\n\n\n\nWeb3 project without loops. The challenge is dwindling $TOKEN supply and no long-term sustainability.\n\nThe main problem with this is that the founding team needs to continually dip into its supply of tokens to fund itself. That supply continues to dwindle, especially if the project has to pivot towards hitting product-market fit. With each dilution event, the founders\u2019 incentive to make the project succeed is further diminished. If the supply gets badly reduced, the team will need to sell company stock or a second token, which then risks misalignment of incentives.\n\nCan we do better? The image below shows an improvement, which some Web3 projects are doing. Taking a cue from businesses and nations, it introduces revenue generation (bottom right). Revenue is then looped back to Workers, in a curated fashion (middle-left). Projects are chosen based on growth potential and alignment with the project\u2019s mission. Funding can go to the founding team and other project teams. They all perform *work* to grow the $TOKEN value and network revenue. And the loop continues.\n\n\n\nRevenue generation can draw on ideas from Web1 & Web2 businesses \u2014 but with less extractive rates. Importantly, the token must be designed such that its value rises as usage rises.\n\nBut there\u2019s still one big problem: too little revenue, too late. I\u2019ll elaborate.\n\nIf rates are too high, it will either get forked and re-deployed with lower rates, or it won\u2019t get adopted because it\u2019s seen as too extractive.\nIf rates are too low (and usage isn\u2019t sufficient) then revenue is too low.\nEither way, teams won\u2019t have enough funding to keep growing the project. They will stoically or heroically keep going for a while, until they can\u2019t feed their family. Some may pull through. And most will be forced to stop, at which point the project begins its fade into oblivion.\n\n(6) Web3 Sustainability / Growth Models \u2014 A Fuller Picture\nGood news! We can overcome the challenge of \u201ctoo little revenue, too late\u201d. It takes a key change: rather than disburse all the tokens at the beginning of the project, disburse a large fraction of tokens over a much longer period of time to the workers that are adding value to the project. This gives teams a longer runway to iterate towards product-market fit (PMF), and more funds to catalyze growth once PMF is achieved.\n\nI call this the Web3 Sustainability Loop. The image below illustrates this. It has parallels to successful nations and successful businesses. At its heart is a loop, designed for \u201csnowball effect\u201d growth of the ecosystem. The Workers (center) do *work* to help grow the Web3 Project Ecosystem (right). Apps and services generate revenue, using the Web3 project\u2019s tools. A non-extractive fraction of that revenue is looped back (arrow looping from right to left) as Network revenue to the Web3 community: to Buy & Burn $TOKEN (bottom left) and back to workers curated by the community according (center-left). To catalyze growth and ensure decent funding in early days, Network rewards (left) also feed to Workers.\n\n\n\nWeb3 sustainability/growth model including an \u201couter wrapper\u201d that includes $TOKEN disbursement over time as a tool, in addition to network revenue.\n\nHere\u2019s the loop, in words:\n\nProjects are proposed, and curated, by the community.\nProjects are funded by Network revenue, and Network reward.\nAs projects do *work* and add value, network revenue", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": {"channel": 1032788394893398026}, "index": 2, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "a46cc6b3-f29e-4990-8a0c-ec9c6a57c3ce", "node_info": {"start": 25141, "end": 38589}}, {"text": "generate revenue, using the Web3 project\u2019s tools.

This incentivizes projects to seek external funding, such as matching investments or quadratic funding.\"\n\nValue can only be added to an ecosystem if the core product being built (by core devs) has last-mile apps for users (by app devs), which users can discover and find useful (go-to-market work). It\u2019s a chain going from core product \u2192 dapps \u2192 discovery & usage \u2192 actual value add.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1300723135076093952?s=20&t=MSD9OSy34xRIMio_NBeA0w\n\nhere's a tweetstorm related to this article\n\nhttps://youtube.com/clip/UgkxXnMHir7wy6sxD1MQ4mofl0zQmn-1ojMu\n\n\ud83e\udde0 \ud83d\udcaf  <@753720709032968213> would love to do another lunch n learn sometime about your learnings\n\nOhh good idea!!\n\nI\u2019ll be back mid-December\n\nLet\u2019s do one then like the 11th\n\ni'll be back from india dec 18th!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/nathanlawkc/status/1596842009364500481 , not sure if there's much research but found it interesting \ud83d\ude42\n\nNICE! ---- When k < 0, the space expands forever.

H \u2261 \n\u0227 / a\n is the Hubble parameter.\n\nThe Hubble parameter can change over time if other parts of the equation are time dependent (in particular the mass density, the vacuum energy, or the spatial curvature). Evaluating the Hubble parameter at the present time yields Hubble's constant which is the proportionality constant of Hubble's law. Applied to a fluid with a given equation of state, the Friedmann equations yield the time evolution and geometry of the universe as a function of the fluid density.\n\na is the scale factor which is taken to be 1 at the present time. k is the current spatial curvature (when a = 1). If the shape of the universe is hyperspherical and Rt is the radius of curvature (R0 at the present), then a = \nRt / R0. If k is positive, then the universe is hyperspherical. If k = 0, then the universe is flat. If k is negative, then the universe is hyperbolic.\n\nHere's a cool post on it: https://blogs.futura-sciences.com/e-luminet/2015/05/03/rise-big-bang-models-3-friedmanns-dynamical-solutions/\n\n<@904452225554874379> good to see you today!

I find their docs / process very interesting. i think we probably could learn a fair bit from these folks.\n\nI\u2019ve printed it out and I\u2019m bringing it on the plane. I feel that a few reads will stick it. It\u2019s important not to be intimidated by texts like this! It\u2019s like Feynman said - you don\u2019t just read a paper instantly - it takes some time. There are new words and phrases here, and the unfamiliar is the only thing getting in the way of reading. Skimming, relaxing, and just kind of floating over the paper without judging yourself for not immediately getting it is important.\n\nI know the author well. But! The first time I met him, my first thought was that he spoke like a textbook. And I thought he was trying to be official And unnecessarily formal! \n\nit was hard for me to hear through that. After talking with him a lot more, and then joining a working group with him around solving problems at the edge of what\u2019s possible with data DAOs - I will say that he has a very precise way of saying things, but once I\u2019ve gotten used to it the precision is incredible. I feel like once I read it I should make some notes and post some here!\n\nThanks much for sharing this. The (totally unexplained) analytic frame of 'political economy' via input/output or marginal analysis makes the argument somewhat wordy and inaccessible/obscure in places, but I appreciated its clarity on the challenges DAOs will face and how to prepare for them. \n\nSection IV is the most important imo and also the most concrete, so I'll share my pull-quotes from the more 'abstract'/generalized earlier sections:\n\nFrom Section I:\n\n> The questions of central relevance to governance of impersonal organizations are those surrounding disagreement or dispute among members.\n\nFrom Section II:\n\n> Therefore, the potential value of new organizational forms cannot be understood without a firm grounding in the efficiencies (and equities) that existing legacy systems have provided. The benefits of traditional organizational hierarchies can be summarized as attracting specialized individuals and concentrating their incentives to make value-adding decisions on the part of the larger whole. Furthermore, creating an organizational shell within which people can coordinate their productive activity has benefits in terms of reduction of transaction costs (Coase 1937) and incentive problems associated with investment (Williamson 1985; 2003).\u00a0\n\n> Thus, one overarching structural weakness to which DAOs are subject is those of the costs associated with democratization of decision-making among organization members. In many contexts, this low engagement is rational \u2013 it is inefficient to vote on the operating and governance decisions of every organization against which someone has a claim against future returns or output.\n\n>  Nonetheless, these existing systems of private governance have their own serious drawbacks, which makes the narrative thus far unfair to DAOs\u2019 potential. This is for two reasons: intrinsic (ideological) valuations and the possibility for ongoing institutional innovation. These also provide the basis for identification of the set of core values likely to create a community constitution whose formalization (and ongoing gap filling role in cases of Knightian uncertainty) is one that is a direct input to resilience, as a function of the internal political economy that this constitution reflects and thus shapes in an ongoing sense.\n\n> Therefore, the costs are lower to DAO organization than a strictly economic calculus would suggest due to the tendency for those engaged in these communities to intrinsically value the process itself, and that the sustainability of a DAO\u2019s governance will hinge on how well it can attract members who have this intrinsic motivation (alongside economic or philanthropic alignment with the DAOs purpose). This intrinsic valuation for DAO governance means that a subset of DAO projects will succeed in overcoming the relative inefficiencies of decentralized governance noted thus far.\n\n> Therefore, there are dynamic reasons to be cautiously optimistic about the institutional development that is likely to occur as DAOs emerge, compete for members, occasionally spectacularly fail, and eventually converge upon efficient design features that enable them to capture private and philanthropic market share by finding a niche where this form of governance is more efficient, and/or is able to attract a subset of members (whether investors or donors) who are willing to pay a premium for this specific form of governance.\n\nhttps://advanced-hindsight.com/\n\nOh wow! This is amazing!\n\nFrom Section III:\n\n> The study of legal transitions identifies how any institutional change tends to create winners and losers compared to the status quo, a direct testament to how the outcome of any given collective choice process will be a subject of disagreement in part due to the way in which the change affects the balance of interests among organization members.\n\n> Notably, DAOs\u2019 constitutive choices tend to involve forms of democratic input as a function of network activity or staked value, which makes them necessarily reflect a form of constitutional ordering more so than traditional firm governance. This means DAOs will be subject to internal collective choice dilemmas at a greater level than the centralized autocratic decision-making that is associated with private economic organizations.

More generally, an organization\u2019s chosen purpose, through reifying a constitutive set of shared values, defining an internal political economy, and a set of competing organizations which members can plausibly join, is a principal determinant of the heterogeneity of member\u2019s preferences with respect to collective action.\n\n> Even though collective action poses representative losses to all members, these losses increase as heterogeneity of governance preferences increases within a given organization, because of the mechanical way in which heterogeneity of governance preferences make collective action more costly. A chosen purpose for an organization greatly defines an internal plurality of interests whose gains and losses to any institutional change in turn partially determine the scope of institutional change that is possible. Similarly, like-minded individuals can disagree in good faith about how to proceed in cases of uncertainty, and the more the unforeseen event is unlike anything that came previously, the more this disagreement is likely.undefined\u00a0A plurality of visions as to how to proceed are thus themselves a critical source of disagreement for governance of large impersonal organizations. Finally, competitor\u2019s governance and production choices themselves constrain the choices of any given organization, such that a chosen purpose (through determining competitive substitute purposes) is also choosing a set of constraints of governance decisions that are possible to resolve political economic and uncertainty-related disputes within a given organization. This makes institutions to accommodate disagreement as necessary for all collective action organizations at impersonal scale, institutions whose value increases given divergence in shared values within a particular organization.\n\nThis last chunk essentially defines three sources of discord among DAO members: (1) the constitution of their shared values, with its differing interpretations, (2) the plurality of visions that these interpretations give rise to, and (3) the external frictions the organization's actions are liable to produce.\n\nThe fourth and final sections give examples and some institutional mechanisms for handling these disputes, which I'm still mulling over as they are directly related to NetaDAO's operating agreement that I'm helping draft.\n\nYou REALLY got the essence of this essay. Oh my gosh.\n\nThese notes totally make it possible for me to parse this work in a really solid way now.\n\nIn real life, Eric talks like he writes. It\u2019s pretty incredible.\n\n<a:OH_peepoNerd:850484888649859072>\n\nWould love to see the operating agreement if it\u2019s public at some point.\n\nI\u2019m personally running into an issue where myself and another party worked on a project, but organizational debt added up and the cybernetic feedback loop turned negative.\n\nI like how Eric points out the gap between starting a traditional org with a background of law or finance or business, and then the fact that anybody can create a DAO, yet not necessarily have the tools to do that organizational process Or any experience with procedure in this shape whatsoever. \n\nAnd that gap can get groups of well-meaning people into some pretty miserable interpersonal conditions and cycles. I\u2019m definitely not as articulate is eric on these points, which is why I\u2019m so interested in reading his work. I\u2019m really glad you got something out of this, and I am super impressed by the summary of points. It\u2019s going to be super helpful to me as well.\n\nI\u2019d love to see a diagram, or maybe just create one of this gap. People go to undergrad and graduate school just to be able to deal with the basics of these human complexities. People go to court over issues that are not well defined. And yet all of us, few who have degrees, and more importantly, experience in diplomacy, organization, bookkeeping, and law, are almost arbitrarily creating these social constructs, and then getting hit with organizational issues after the initial feel good period is done.\n\nI have an OA draft up under the NetaDAO #governance-legal channel. Once we officially get our LLC incorporation process going (I have to put up proposal today), we'll have a 30-day open 'Assembly' to hash out the OA more exactly. What I have on the OA (and our separate Org Chart) right now is mostly structural descriptions of where everything/everyone is. Section IV here has given me some ideas for thinking about handling disagreements and mediating issues among subDAOs/etc.\n\nI\u2019m on UTC -7 so super late for me but this has been really cool getting to learn more about what you\u2019re working on. I have to join the Discord and check it out.\n\nI feel there's a lot of openness on where the emphasis on \"autonomy\" happens or can be placed in a DAO. The essay presents DAOs as incurring higher operating costs on the assumption that the autonomy is that of the total DAO. I suppose one could also interpret 'DAO autonomy' as meaning a collective empowering the autonomy of its subunits or representative structures.\n\nThis ambiguity likewise exists around interpretations of the phrase \"We the People,\" where it's been argued (in the US) that \"the people\" is the pure/direct count of individuals OR the group of states. The Constitution didn't so much resolve the problem as accept both: the House of Representatives was supposed to be proportional to the population, while the Senate was a fixed representation of states.\n\nI've been thinking about all this recently as models for NetaDAO and for DAOs more generally, so I'm happy to geek out and share with others. <:PES5_NerdWow:827518508409683978>\n\ni really like the approach described here for budget selection:\n\nhttps://blog.colony.io/introducing-budgetbox/#thinking-inside-the-box\n\neffectively, they have voters \"play a game\" where they select pairwise preferences (i think X is more important than Y) for a subset of all possible pairs. they then aggregate those preferences into a budget distribution. this reminds me a fair bit of the recent Osmosis grants proposal and seems like a reasonably proposal for a better way to manage DAO budgeting.\n\nin our case, \"budget distribution\" would likely go to subDAOs who are then charged with executing within their budget\n\nI read over this conversation yesterday, printed out paper also, and really appreciated <@503057962852548608> notes too! (Thanks!)  Then today at a web3 Governance conference here in Melbourne I met Eric and found you\u2019re really right! He does talk like he rights. He is next level.\n\nIs there any info on how they actually set up their pairwise preference quizzes? I can imagine that going in a lot of directions.\n\ngreat question :) the stuff i saw there was pretty hazy. it seems like they give each person a random fixed-size selection of pair, and ranks their preference. then, they use (and i quote) \"machine learning\" to build some probability based ordering of the options which they turn into funding gauges.\n\nit's pretty hazy, but the article links to some additional material which may have the details\n\nI posted a rough draft of my Orientation to our Operating Agreement work over on the server. Hopefully I'll revise sections 2 and 4 before Monday, but would be interested in any feedback based on your research on organizational design if you have some time. <:PES_Embarrassed:643089267932790797> <:pepethumbsup:774587160731844649>\n\ncc <@904452225554874379>\n\nhttps://noidea.dog/glue\n\nGreat article about glue!\n\nReading research papers can be intimidating.\n\nThe key is not trying to understand everything in the first pass.

The connection-oriented cluster matching model seems like a productive start for DAOs/chains that are planning to use subDAOs. The \"coarseness\"/abstraction of the argument left me wondering how exactly to measure such things as contributions and group belonging per se, but the proof of concept seems valid if those can be satisfactorily worked out.\n\nThe issue of measuring contributor contribution for Quadratic Funding (if it isn't simply a dollar/token amount, but also involves 'sweat equity' and other less fungible modes of input), is probably parallel to the problem in Weyl and Posner's Quadratic Voting formulas, in which voters are issued \"voice shares\" that they use to make their voices louder or quieter on certain issues... Weyl and Posner present this as a way of protecting minority rights outside judicial oversight, but that's only if you can issue 'voice shares' in a way that satisfies participants. It's possible to simply drain/fatigue some groups' shares by putting their rights up for referendum, thus depleting their input in other areas of policy. Put otherwise, the QV model might just as quickly accentuate extremism and polarization, especially since caring about more policy initiatives reduces the weight of your vote on any individual initiative. The same happens with measuring nonfungible contributions for QF, especially when people are contributing across multiple operational initiatives.\n\nAbsolutely agree about accentuating a gazillion micro-dystopias or worse -- I personally think commodified labor is the issue and something like a graph of work (directed, one can only hope *loopy thoughts*) could be an interesting data structure to use when formally defining notions of fairness or social choice\n\nWith a dependency graph of what is accomplished, one can more precisely specify the geometry of fairness, and retroactive compensation can proceed along the lines of free energy minimization principle or similar work graph traversal mechanism\n\nQF / QV come from a good place, but in the end can only operate within the ontologies of modern monetary theory or principal agent in a bureaucratic nation-state\n\nYep, I very much like the idea of tying organizational funding to 'consilience' or broad agreement across organizational members. And I found much to ponder on their proposal to weight consilience by clusters/groups vs rational isolated individuals. It seems that it will always be a 'political' issue how to measure groups and their overlaps, with an inescapable judicial component involved (even if it's handled by 'ordinary'/nontrained members).\n\nFor something completely(?) different: https://youtu.be/AP3zeHyWakw\n\nhttps://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/particle-lenia/\n\n> As we see, the total system energy is mostly decreasing through a series of phase transitions between different formations. Nevertheless there are intervals where the energy is increasing. Why is this happening? Shouldn't the system that follows the energy gradient, eventually find a stable local minima? Turns out that there is one subtle detail which makes the dynamics much more interesting. Each particle greedily minimizes its own energy without considering its influence on other particles.\n> [....]\n> We can see that the global optimization indeed drives the system into a stable low-energy state. Once we switch to the local rule, the system escapes this state and enters a dynamic attractor similar to the one from the previous simulation.\n\n<:pog:1034269207594020864>\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800919310067\n\nenergy sections are just excellent and echo / converge on many of the essential tenets of what we've been working on over at Plurigrid for many months\n\nAlso the money / debt parts are quite on point IMO!

This belief is subtly reinforced by the fact that many scientists still think the emergence of life was a fortuitous accident that required a good roll of the molecular dice, in a place where the conditions are just so, in a Universe where the laws of physics are just right.\n\nThe opposing view is that matter tends to organize itself according to general principles, making the eventual emergence of life inevitable. Such principles would not require any modifications of the laws of physics, but would come from a better understanding of how complex behaviour arises from the interaction of simple components.\n\nIn their book Into the Cool, Eric Schneider and Dorion Sagan claim that non-equilibrium thermodynamics provides the key principle that has been lacking. They review its application to topics ranging from fluid dynamics and meteorology to the origin of life, ecology, plant physiology, and evolutionary biology, and even speculate about its relevance to health, economics and metaphysics. The book contains a wealth of good references and is worth buying for this reason alone.\n\n\"The truly dangerous ideas in science tend to be those that threaten the collective ego of humanity and knock us further off our pedestal of centrality.\"\n\n\"The dangerous idea is this: the purpose of life is to disperse energy.\"\n\nhttps://www.edge.org/response-detail/10674#:~:text=More%20generally%2C%20as%20stated%20by,example%2C%20in%20temperature%20or%20pressure.\n\n\"Nobel laureate Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was one of the first to articulate the hypothesis, as part of his famous \"What is Life\" lectures in Dublin in 1943. More recently, Jeffrey Wicken, Harold Morowitz, Eric Schneider and others have taken this concept considerably further, buoyed by results from a range of studies, particularly within ecology. Schneider and Dorian Sagan provide an excellent summary of this hypothesis in their recent book, \"Into the Cool\".\"\n\n<@676640406875930644> re: wet bulb conditons\n\n\"If a thermometer is wrapped in a water-moistened cloth, it will behave differently. The drier and less humid the air is, the faster the water will evaporate. The faster water evaporates, the lower the thermometer's temperature will be relative to air temperature.:\n\n\"Water can evaporate only if the air around it can absorb more water. This is measured by comparing how much water is in the air to the maximum that could be in the air\u2014the relative humidity. 0% means the air is completely dry, and 100% means the air contains all the water it can hold in the present circumstances and it cannot absorb any more water (from any source).\"\n\n\"This is part of the cause of apparent temperature in humans. The drier the air, the more moisture it can take up beyond what is already in it, and the easier it is for extra water to evaporate. The result is that sweat evaporates more quickly in drier air, cooling down the skin faster. If the relative humidity is 100%, no water can evaporate, and cooling by sweating or evaporation is not possible.\"\n\nDefinition: The wet-bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that may be achieved by evaporative cooling of a water-wetted, ventilated surface.\n\n---\n\nAnyway -- there will be more of these!\n\n---\n\nBack to the \"Into the Cool\"\n\n\"The twist is to claim that the need to reduce energy gradients drives a tendency towards increasing complexity in both living and non-living systems. In their words: \u201cEven before natural selection, the second law \u2018selects\u2019, from the kinetic, thermodynamic, and chemical options available, those systems best able to reduce gradients under given constraints.\u201d For example, they argue that the reason a climax forest replaces an earlier transition forest is that it is more efficient at fixing energy from the Sun, which also reduces the temperature gradient. They claim that the competition to reduce gradients introduces a force for selection, in which less effective mechanisms to reduce gradients are replaced by more effective ones. They argue that this is the fundamental reason why both living and non-living systems tend to display higher levels of organization over time.\"\n\n\"This is an intriguing idea but I am not convinced that it makes sense. The selection process that the authors posit is never clearly defined, and they never explain why, or in what sense, it necessarily leads to increasing complexity. No one would dispute that the second law of thermodynamics is important for understanding the functioning of complex systems. Being out of equilibrium is a necessary condition for a physical phenomenon to display interesting complex behaviour, even if \u2018interesting\u2019 remains difficult to define. But the authors' claim that non-equilibrium thermodynamics explains just about everything falls flat. For example, consider a computer. No one would dispute that a power supply is essential. Even for a perfectly efficient computer, thermodynamics tells us that it takes at least kT ln2 energy units to erase a bit, where T is the temperature and k is the Boltzmann constant. But the need for power tells us nothing about what makes a laptop different from a washing machine. To understand how a computer works, and what it can and cannot do, requires the theory of computation, which is a logical theory that is disconnected from thermodynamics. The power supply can be designed by the same person who designs them for washing machines.\" https://www.nature.com/articles/436627a\n\nI'm interested in both the idea and the critiques of the idea\n\nI also like this one \"Life relies on the ability of matter to store information and to implement functional relationships, which allow organisms to maintain their form and execute purposeful behaviours that enhance their survival. Such complex order depends on the rules by which matter interacts. It may well be that many of the details are not important, and that there are general principles that might allow us to determine when the result will be organization and when it will be chaos. But this cannot be understood in terms of thermodynamics alone.\"\n\nfun stuff: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Is-the-climate-system-an-anticipatory-system-that-Rubin-Crucifix/9bb9f270adf88eda156b8852142b7fa41fd6dac5\n\n<@755585146140491956> <@676640406875930644> <@181607258512162816> <@898769611200274482> Here's the paper on Awe from the day before!\n\n<@755585146140491956> I tried writing every morning when waking up so far.\n\nIt's been amazing!\n\nyesss thank you for sending all this\n\nNP!\n\nlol.

There are several texts which have dealt with the havoc that language acquisition plays on human mirror neurons and the consequent damming of spontaneous human sympathy/emotion; I believe Rizzolatti (who won the Nobel for his work on mirror neurons) or one of his original team members has written about the rewiring of the brain due to language acquisition, good if you read Italian, but if not another important source is Angela Friederici's _Language in Our Brain: The Origins of a Uniquely Human Capacity._ I would argue it's through this sabotage of spontaneous affect by language that 'symbols' or 'the symbolic' as such becomes operative in human biology and especially in human societies/organizations (which are, I think this paper  would argue, themselves products of biology). It's worth noting imo that this rewiring happens between the ages of 3-11, when the child is not just mastering language but more specifically learning to use negation operators and to speak of what is not, of reality versus possibility or fantasy. For this reason there's a sempiternal dysfunction and disorientation to human reality.\n\nThis is really a minor point I'm making, but it ramifies down into a comment from Section 3.2:\n\n> But when trading stocks, playing video games or building shopping centers, there is no instinctual \u2018full\u2019 signal in modern brains - so we become addicted to the \u2018unexpected reward\u2019 of the next encounter, episode, or email, at an ever increasing pace\n\nI too question whether there are instinctual signals for anything as specific as \"trading stocks,\" \"playing video games,\" etc\u2014but I don't tie my suspicion to a \"stone-age mind\" hypothesis. Rather, I adopt a view of the human organism as primarily formed and responding to linguistically-bound and hence aim-inhibited drives rather than natural instincts\u2014desire wears Reason like a mask, and it is easy to interpret some masks as nature. What perhaps is most 'natural' to human nature is the fact of masking or doubling nature itself. In some sense, we might think of language as an originary mask or double for the world, and which leaves much of our human world subject to the vicissitudes of treaties and contracts and promises, but also the violation of those\u2014meaning war, a phenomenon that seems alien to even our most closely related animal kin. (One here might think of Franz Kafka's observation that the animals can be so sanguine because _they_ never left the Garden of Eden...)\n\nFrom Section 3.4:\n\n> We have great intentions for the future, until the future becomes today. Our neocortex can imagine them, but we are emotionally blind to long-term issues like climate change or energy depletion.\u00a0_Emotionally, the future isn\u2019t real._\n\nI don't buy that our brain anatomy means \"the future\" is only a conceptual imagining rather than an affective reality. Discrepancies between present descriptions of our preferred future states and those actual future states are surely more multifactored than that. Emerson's quip that \"Our moods do not believe in each other\" would be a better entry.\n\nFrom Section 3.5:\n\n> We are also primed to cooperate with our in-group whether that is a small business, large corporation, or even a nation-state - to obtain monetary (or in earlier times, physical) surplus.\n\nI agree obtaining surplus is a major purpose of many cooperative enterprises (though not all), but I wonder how much this construction has things backward: it's surplus that _causes_ human cooperation\u2014e.g., surplus of feeling/affect or even cognition, such as one finds around the anarchist concept of \"mutual aid.\" \n\nFrom Section 3.6:\n\n> Since the Neolithic, human society has organized around growth of surplus, initially measured physically e.g. grain, now measured by digital claims on physical surplus, (or money)\u00a0\n\nThe slide or sleight of hand which converts 3.5's \"monetary [...] surplus\" to the total equivocation of surplus and money\u2014needs some pressure put on it, less because I think it's wrong than because it's so suggestive it needs more unpacking (for me). On one hand, I could imagine \"money is (a proxy for) surplus\" as superficially compatible with George Gilder's definition of money as a measure or proxy for wealth; on the other hand, that superficial compatibility is broken by acknowledging that Gilder's definition of wealth is knowledge, a store of learning, and it's difficult to know what \"surplus knowledge\" would exactly mean, and whether it would bear an historically acknowledged relation to surplus grain. Though I think one possible definition of \"surplus knowledge\" in the above sense could be: philosophy or philosophizing, the over-thinking of things. <:cPES_Wink:623401321382281226> On that note, I would probably want to trace the money concept to one of the earliest human institutions, i.e., promising. Promises are \"performatives\" in the sense that they do not simply describe the world but _change_ it or _enact_ their contents. (Other performatives include the marital vow \"I do\" and the christening of ships, neither of which describe the world as it is but change or add some surplus to how the world can be described; this surplus in language that has physical weight might be called\u2014why not\u2014'libido,' a psychical energetics at some fractured remove from physical energetics.) Consequently one way to understand performatives is as testing or sounding the strength of a social field, and that is why I describe promising as among the oldest of human institutions. The money concept seems to me an outgrowth of this promissory institution of language rather than commodity exchange\u2014and I should note that for this reason I also decline 'chartalist' or State-based theories of money as overstating their case. Anyway, I don't disagree with money and surplus being linked, but I want it finer tuned. Anne Carson's _Economy of the Unlost_ explores one of the first ardent users of coinage, the poet Simonides of Keos, who charged for his verses, and which poses some surprisingly subtle problems with both commodity and chartalist theories of money.\n\n(On this point I will add that at the recent Game of Nodes session, the host kind of needled Jake on Juno's Prop 16 drama and asked why companies would build on chains where their assets can be voted away. However, the real question is: Why do they do that already, rather than taking to the high seas and declaring independence as pirates? A main reason: actually a lot of people don't like shopping with pirates. The US recently seized SBF's personal Robinhood stocks, and I think many people feel that is the correct move. The social design aspect of the crypto revolution is an essential part of its long-term promise and appeal, not something to be ashamed of or shy away from; and we shouldn't cede way to romantic but reckless (and almost always cruel) fantasies of absolute piratical sovereignty.)\n\nLil D strikes again! \u2728\u2728\u2728\n\nI read Sections 4.0-4.2 as introducing but somewhat skirting or downplaying the mystery of homeostasis. It sounds sensible and 'economic' enough to say:\n\n> Organisms utilize foraging strategies that optimize energy intake vs. energy expenditure adjusted for time and risk.\n\nbut if organisms really did merely optimize in this way, then why the hell are there so many organisms with so many varying sets of (alleged) optimization? And if bodies are optimized for homeostasis, then why do they so often fail to achieve it? Another way of putting this might be: Why bother with _any_ nonzero homeostasis? Zero intake and zero expenditure are ostensibly the easiest or most sustainable of all homeostatic equilibria. It might be the case that Life is \"miraculous\" or some kind of separate or counterforce to the inorganic; but another possibility is that the inorganic itself might not designate a zero-sum inertia... Again my point here isn't so much to suggest the claim is wrong or inaccurate as that it could benefit from deeper exfoliation.\n\nFrom Section 4.6:\n\n> _Economists view capital, labor and human creativity as primary and energy secondary or absent. The opposite is, in fact, true. We are energy blind._\n\nI appreciate the rhetorical flare. I don't know that it makes sense to relegate either of those to primary/secondary (or absent!?) roles; they seem to me equals, like trying to decide whether the firefighter who connects the hydrant or the firefighter who holds the hose are more responsible for fighting the fire. Arguing about primacy of one part over another here seems to be more politically motivated than guided by careful reasoning, since both are actually necessary for the end result. That said, I do love this provocation, not least because of the way it sets up the punch here from Section 4.7:\n\n> Technology is an expression of the available energy we can exploit (Brockway, 2013). What we call \u201ctechnological progress\u201d at any time is mostly the development of the capital base to support an ever-greater throughput of available energy at a later time.\u00a0\n\nas well as this from Section 4.9:\n\n> Organisms that require more energy to find food than the food contains, will die. We only get away with this because our institutions and policies treat the energy subsidy from fossil hydrocarbons as interest, not principal.\n\nBack to the money concept in Section 4.10:\n\n> Contrary to what is taught in economics textbooks, money is not lent out from existing wealth\u2013 it is created (Werner, 2014;\u00a0Ament, 2019). This new money eventually gets spent on a good or service which will contain\u00a0embodied energy.\u00a0Money is a claim on energy yet its creation is not tethered to energy availability or cost.\n\nHere there's again sleight of hand or too-fast analysis that joins several things together that may appear the same to us only by historical contingency rather than natural necessity. I mean in particular the confusion of the institution of money with the institution of banking, which are several if not separable institutions. The central motor of today's banking, i.e., making loans by creating deposits in accordance with fractional reserve policies, is the definition of what Nakomoto called the \"double-spend problem\"\u2014I say \"today's banking\" but it was a problem in other times and places as well, albeit the process of making and taking loans has varied widely under differing jurisdictions and monetary systems. Finally, I think that \"money is a claim on energy\" is accurate in some reductionist calculus, but it becomes less clear in cases of avarice (or what Aristotle dubbed \"incontinence\") or under wide-scale financialization, which George Gilder defines as the social condition in which money _becomes_ wealth directly, rather than money _being a measure_ of wealth. Still, I'll accept the reductionist calculus as holding good on some 'ultimate' or long-term horizon, where the creation of money runs up against energy availability.\n\nI particularly enjoyed Section 4.11:\n\n> This makes debt more accurately an \u2018intertemporal transfer of\u00a0consumption\u2019 [rather than consumption preferences].\n\nHere again there's a reductionist calculus at work, but I think it has heuristic value. The argument that debt\u2014or, the creation of money untethered from 'real' energy available or 'real' productive forces\u2014is effectively a robbery of future generations is a powerful idea that goes back to the forming of modern republics. Marquis de Sade, the namesake of sadism and an overall degenerate, turned out to write some political tracts of interest while locked away in the Bastille, including a pamphlet, \"One More Effort, Frenchmen, If You Wish To Be Republicans,\" inserted within _Philosophy in the Bedroom_, that effectively argues for the severance of money and state as the necessary final step for truly republican revolution. But of course the issue here was: sever it from state (and hence from gold), _and then what?_ No other systems or technology existed then that could fully replace gold; the printing presses were the best technology for monetary innovation at the time and the lessons of those experiments have formed what we today call 'economics.' A stumbling point I thought showed up at the end of this section here:\n\n> Thus debt can be seen as a tool humans use to access an energy gradient, and the resulting goods and services. Debt has been referred to as \u2018fake energy\u2019 (Weyler, 2011). More accurately, debt moves real energy and consumption from the future, to the present, unsustainably. But it is fake in the sense that to pay back the debt, we have to also pay back the energy. One could say this amount (and related consumption) is \u201cborrowed\u201d energy.\n\nBy the paper's own classification, there are two types of technology: Type 1 that enhances or innovates energy sources, and Type 2 that deploys energy for labor or other ends. Type 1 technology, the mere possibility of which seems to lend credence to the view of a non-zero sum inorganic/natural world, would be the way that debt 'de-frauds' itself. (Sorry for the abuse of defraud.) There's a story in some economics text I've read of an agrarian society where the people believed that if one farmer grew more yams than the other farmers, it was because that farmer had used magic to spirit the other farmers' yams away, and therefore deserved to be punished. This 'zero-sum' view of wealth and productivity is recapitulated here in terms of global energy availability rather than local soil fertility, but at the risk inviting futurism, this latter-day zero-sum view of energy availability seems to depend on ignoring any interstellar or interplanetary energy sources that may become available in the coming decades, and which may make our zero-sum punishments today seem like the punishments of yam farmers in other places.\n\nOn Section 4.12: \n\n> After basic needs are met, the best things in life are free.\n\nI'm dubious about the whole section and its use of social/psychological data, but I'm still sympathetic to the broader point that money doesn't buy happiness.\n\nFigure 8 from Section 5.0 got a chuckle out of me:\n\n\n\nI don't know what monetary/economic history was consulted for this chart (which is admitted to be \"not to scale\"), but I", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": {"channel": 1032788394893398026}, "index": 6, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "a46cc6b3-f29e-4990-8a0c-ec9c6a57c3ce", "node_info": {"start": 80453, "end": 95284}}, {"text": "fertility, but at the risk inviting futurism, this latter-day zero-sum view of energy availability seems to depend on ignoring any interstellar or interplanetary energy sources that may become available in the coming decades, and which may make our zero-sum punishments today seem like the punishments of yam farmers in other places.\n\nOn Section 4.12: \n\n> After basic needs are met, the best things in life are free.\n\nI'm dubious about the whole section and its use of social/psychological data, but I'm still sympathetic to the broader point that money doesn't buy happiness.\n\nFigure 8 from Section 5.0 got a chuckle out of me:\n\n\n\nI don't know what monetary/economic history was consulted for this chart (which is admitted to be \"not to scale\"), but I don't think that money creation and available energy were ever as correlated as all that suggests. Even focusing on the narrower band of time specified, i.e., the dawn of the Industrial Era, it's hard to find much corroboration for the claim that money creation was bound to energy availability. There's even some weird implication here that previous financial crises didn't happen or were somehow trivialized (appearing but as blips on a smooth curve) when compared to that crisis caused by the future outstripping of energy. A broader sense of monetary/economic history would possibly sharpen this argument by demonstrating financial busts/booms (and credit creation more generally) relative to energy sources and Type 1 tech availability at the time, but I suspect the results could be more mixed and raise deeper questions about the relation of energy and monetary systems. I found myself questioning the historical bona fides once again with the following claim:\n\n> These changes allowed economic growth to continue until it hit a wall with conventional finance in 2008 (Point C)\u2013 at which point central banks and global governments were forced to essentially redesign the entire financial system.\n\nI don't think that many people consider post-1970s global finance to be \"conventional finance,\" even if its surprising longevity has given it the appearance of convention. The abandonment of the gold standard and introduction of the \"currency float\" by Nixon and Friedman has meant that today currency trading and speculation make up more global financial activity than almost every other sector combined. (A point I find interesting about Friedman: he also argued that abandoning the gold standard would almost dangerously centralize power over labor value to central bankers and governments, and he consequently proposed a full UBI as a counter-weight to the corruption by printers and speculators.) Indeed, the 1970s or post-Bretton Woods monetary system became known as \"monetarism\" and distanced itself from both market 'fundamentalists' and Keynesian 'radicals', yet tended to do so in practice by adopting the worst and ignoring the best of each.\n\n> We are now heading towards Point D, where our global monetary representations of reality continue to decouple from the underlying biophysical reality (red curve).\n\nInasmuch as I would trace the money concept to the performative institution (or symbolic 'surplus' in physical reality) of promise-making, -breaking, and -keeping, I wonder whether viewing money supply in terms of \"biophysical reality\" or 'real forces of production' (as commodity theory might prefer) isn't missing or distorting something essential about the money concept, if not the 'real' reality itself.\n\nFrom Section 5.1:\n\n> Rather, we have a strong preference for positive experiences in the present moment (Hagens, 2010). Even the ecologically literate will avoid \u2018sustainable\u2019 practices that accomplish equal goals but require more time (Penn, 2019).\n\nHere finally comes another nonnegotiable force, perhaps even more difficult to massage than energy availability: time. To the position that \"money is a claim on energy\" can be opposed the more common understanding that \"money is time,\" more specifically that any healthy monetary system stores/measures the time-value and time-costs of individual and collective learning. \n\nFrom Section 5.2:\n\n> The emergent property of 7.7 billion humans going through their daily lives following simple rules like these is a \u2018Superorganism\u2019 with a 17\u00a0TW metabolism.\n\nThis and the ensuing description through 6.1 of the humanity Superorganism as made up of oil pipes and data cables and orbiting satellites put me in mind of Reza Negarastani's _Cyclonopedia_, a horror-theory novel in which the Middle East/planet becomes cursedly sentient through oil.\n\n> In principle a superorganism could be super intelligent but ours is not.\n\nBanger line, and one of the cooler features made known to us by dynamical systems research: our universe can be written (truly, a uni-verse, a poem of the Oneness of all existence) without for all that having an Author. But immediately following that is this:\n\n> \u00a0In the 1930s economists chose GDP as a metric to track economic activity, not as an end goal. Yet almost 100 years later, our economies unconsciously, relentlessly, pursue the GDP carrot, often toward frivolous endeavors that promise the greatest financial return in the shortest time.\n\nwhich again for me calls into question the overall familiarity with economic/monetary history and policy. And from here follows a long stream of Sections that I find to be of less clear relevance: is the argument that if less money that had been created, there would be less climate change? Again back to this 'ultimate' zero-sum position that sounds sensible but might be ignoring some reality.\n\nIn Section 8:\n\n> Many challenges we face appear as classic social traps, whereby short-term social pressures guide individual behavior in opposition to the best long-run interest of the individual and society (Costanza, 1987).\n\nThis \"social trap\" is sometimes called the Prisoners' Dilemma and describes any decision space where agents would achieve the best outcome for each and all by cooperating but can also achieve a meager to moderate outcome for themselves with penalties for the rest by defecting from the group effort. In short, the risk of cooperating causes the cooperation to fail. Although I would expect this paper to advocate for the side of becoming or 'living up to' a superorganism, it seems to effectively accept defeat and propose reducing the number of agents and constraining the global decision space so as to reduce our superorganism's negative externalities:\n\n> Perhaps the biggest social trap of all is that we don\u2019t actually need all this energy and material stuff to be happy or healthy.\u00a0\n\nThere's something 'off' about this line to me. What if someone's happy and healthy life _does_ require \"all this energy and material stuff\"\u2014not just, e.g., people with disabilities or chronic illnesses with actual needs, but people who genuinely feel their lives are more significant because of their access to these further realms?\n\nI see that Section 9.1 includes a call for UBI but acknowledges what Friedman had feared about unchaining the money supply from gold without UBI: that the unchecked consumption of resources by the rich would devastate the rest and basically render the UBI pointless by its implementation.\n\nSection 9.2 includes this snappy line:\n\n> Finally, just as we discovered that we live in a heliocentric world, and that we evolved, we now begin to see that we are part of a biologically emergent Superorganism which is de-facto eating the planet.\n\nthough the rest of it made me wonder about the issues (not addressed here) of AI replacing labor and the energy and productivity trade-offs.\n\nSection 10 was a let-down! A bunch of rhetorical questions do not make an argument.\n\nSo, the solution proffered here is something like: cull the Superorganism back to a manageable size and curb \"unnecessaries\" (unnecessary to whom, however?) since, apparently, they can never lead to any Type 1 technologies that would obviate the problems raised in the article.... A recurring debate in the US and perhaps elsewhere is the value of (video) gaming, whether it does anything other than allegedly incite violence; yet I suspect some number of computer scientists today got into the field as a result of wanting to make a game of their own when they were young, whether that's what they do now or not. The reduction of \"unnecessaries\" is in any case always a political question with overtones of austerity economics, and as the video game example is meant to demonstrate, reduction of supposed unnecessaries and play can have its own unpredictable and adverse consequences. \n\nAnother solution to the Superorganism/Prisoners' Dilemma was sketched out by Vitalik Buterin in \"Superrationality and DAOs,\" https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/01/23/superrationality-daos, in which he argues that the Prisoner's Dilemma can be resolved, especially at scale, if there exists a means of ascertaining the _virtue_ of other participants. This is where the DAO becomes important, because the DAO's activities are on a public blockchain and its virtue\u2014its likelihood to defect and betray the group\u2014can be assessed in unprecedented forms, thus unlocking \"superrational\" coordinations of human activity and interests.\n\nOf course Buterin's piece is speculative (it's from _2015_), so it would be useful to pair it with perusal of a more recent statement, e.g., \"DAOs Are Not Corporations,\" https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/09/20/daos.html. I would prefer to understand corporations/companies as any organized or collective action at scale, often (but not always) via financial instruments, but Buterin mostly uses the term here to refer to for-profit, executive-led, C-corp types of corporation, or what he calls the authoritarian \"stereotypical large corporations.\" This may be a semantic squabble. In any case, Buterin notes:\n\n> Many of the more recent DAOs differ from earlier DAOs, like MakerDAO, in that whereas the earlier DAOs are organized around\u00a0providing infrastructure, the newer DAOs are organized around\u00a0performing various tasks around a particular theme.\u00a0\n\nThis contains the key development in the argument: the \"virtue\" of DAOs in \"Superrationality\" now becomes the \"credible fairness\" of DAOs in the engagement of some pursuits. This is at issue because DAOs do not simply resist nation-states, but may even take over functions of nation-states: thus they need to demonstrate credibility and credible fairness at levels commensurate with those being subsumed.\n\nFor Buterin, there are three meaningful ways to achieve credibility and demonstrate it, but only one is readily available for DAOs:\n\n> There are typically three ways of dealing with these types of corruption and insider trading issues:\n> \n> \u2014 Retroactively punish\u00a0malicious deciders.\n> \u2014 Proactively\u00a0filter for higher-quality\u00a0deciders.\n> \u2014 Add\u00a0more\u00a0deciders.\n> \n> The corporate world typically focuses on the first two, using financial surveillance and judicious penalties for the first and in-person interviews and background checks for the second. The decentralized world has less access to such tools: project tokens are likely to be tradeable anonymously, DAOs have at best limited recourse to external judicial systems, and the remote and online nature of the projects and the desire for global inclusivity makes it harder to do background checks and informal in-person \"smell tests\" for character. Hence, the decentralized world needs to put more weight on the third technique: distribute decision-making power among\u00a0more\u00a0deciders, so that each individual decider has less power, and so collusions are more likely to be whistleblown on and revealed.\n\nIn contrast to the Hagens article, Buterin envisions a solution to unchecked deleterious consumption through increasing participation rather than limiting it and removing 'unnecessaries.' I incline more towards Buterin's position although I recognize some of his idealism in just assuming sufficiently broad participation, thereby sidestepping the question of how participation becomes broad in the first place. For myself, I say that decentralization (like democracy) is a regulatory or legislative ideal rather than particular achievable states; in reality we are always dealing with representative systems and delegated authority\u2014and this isn't some evil that has to be stomped out, it's part of our condition as social creatures. If each person counts as an element in a set, then each group of people is a subset, and we know by the power law that there are always more subsets than elements of a set (in fact, there are 2^n more subsets than elements of a set of n elements). To return some earlier language here: Representation, or 'the symbolic' more broadly, necessarily suffuses the lives of beings which recognize themselves as beings of beings\u2014or even recognize themselves as beings of Being, if in a philosophical mood. <:feelsOldMan:1051281090784022670>\n\nAhem, **clears throat*, having gone through all that... I understand some of what you're saying here (\"I know some of those words!\") and the two questions you raise (about oracle security and more general oracle provenance, as I understand it) are indeed those of the Superorganism/DAO problem. The Hagens Superorganism solution might be to restrict unnecessaries and focus on quality sources; the Buterin DAO solution is to multiply sources to drown out bad quality. Yet I think Hagens is still correct to point out that some things, such as energy availability, cannot be drowned out or conjured away. But I'm not convinced that \"money is energy,\" nor even \"money is time\"\u2014one formula I find more intriguing is that money is \"frozen desire,\" a more plaintive formula is that money 'measures' the informational (rather than biophysical) economy. I'm not sure that any of this helps you, or that either Hagens or Buterin offer much help for your use-case dealing with particular kinds of data and data sources, but it is always interesting to me to see how people are responding to these design challenges. Unfortunately I don't really know anything about code or programming (at the moment); most of my abilities/interactions in the space so far are constrained to providing descriptions or redescriptions of some systems and ideas in what I hope are clarifying or at least interesting terms to help others work through their own questions.

Most things in the universe aren't. And everything that is alive traces back to things that, puzzlingly, weren't.\nFor centuries, the scientific question of life's origins has confounded us. But in Every Life Is on Fire, physicist Jeremy England argues that the answer has been under our noses the whole time, deep within the laws of thermodynamics. England explains how, counterintuitively, the very same forces that tend to tear things apart assembled the first living systems.\nBut how life began isn't just a scientific question.

What follows are just preliminary notes with some general thoughts in relation to designing DAOs, which I'd normally keep to my research journal, but I thought typing them up might have some tangential interest to someone here:\n\nRavaisson argues (_pace_ and proleptically to Bergson) that habit\u2014which demands repetition, stereotypy, discipline\u2014paradoxically _suffuses the body with freedom._ I might even say habit introduces a second-order freedom: a freedom not only to perform certain actions, but to perform them _more or less well,_ i.e., to artfully or virtuously (as in: virtuoso) perform actions. (For more on virtue/virtuosity, consult Paolo Virno's essay \"Virtuosity and Revolution: The Political Theory of Exodus,\" which appears here:\u00a0https://www.generation-online.org/c/fcmultitude2.html\u00a0but has also been slightly updated/revised for his recent collection _The Idea of World_.)\n\nOne of the major insights of psychoanalysis\u2014which, as Deleuze correctly notes, refers to habit/homeostasis as \"pleasure principle\"\u2014is that in the living/organic being, or at least in human beings, there is some motor \"beyond the pleasure principle\" (i.e. beyond habit), something which (as Lacan will later explain) shears or splits pleasure from satisfaction, such that humans are capable of finding satisfaction in their own misery and unpleasure.\u00a0\n\nFreud somewhat controversially calls this motor \"the death drive,\" but it is actually a profoundly creative force as well: it makes possible human engagement beyond the limits of 'economic sense,' fomenting our work in arts, sciences, politics, and beyond. So the point is not about eliminating this \"death drive,\" which would paradoxically drain human reality of its life. But there is no denying that people often show up in analysis precisely when they (or, sometimes, their friends or family) have recognized this miserable satisfaction as counter to their flourishing.\u00a0\n\nOne job of analysis is therefore to put the harness of desire back on unruly satisfaction. It is only by targeting this deeper motor (i.e., death drive) that one has a chance of meaningfully changing (or changing one's second-order relation to) one's habits\u2014hence not only of what actions one performs, but of performing one's existing repertoire of actions more or less \"well,\" i.e., more or less in conformity with one's desire. At the same time, the death drive also means that all habit and all pleasure is split from within, and thus that living bodies will never be able to cultivate perfect habits, and living bodies themselves will never be perfectible.\u00a0\n\nHuman reality, our life in common, is therefore split, riven between (i) our use of words which say more and less than we mean, and (ii) the umbral tide of satisfactions which we do not want. (The 'living our' or embodiment of this split might be a candidate description for human sexuality.)\n\nWhat has any of this to do with designing DAOs? If a system is supposed to be decentralized and public, then it should take care to observe human nature so as not to pointlessly repress behaviors but to cultivate the interface between system and members.\n\nSome have argued\u2014such as Vitalik Buterin\u2014that mere transparency or publicity are sufficient to overcome the 'corrupting' or colluding forces that can arise in an organization, cf:\n\n> Hence, the decentralized world needs to put more weight on the third technique: distribute decision-making power among\u00a0more\u00a0deciders, so that each individual decider has less power, and so collusions are more likely to be whistleblown on and revealed. (\"DAOs are not corporations,\"\u00a0https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/09/20/daos.html)\n\nThis is consistent with Buterin's overall position on lying and deception, which draws from machine learning research to make claims about human cognition\u2014to wit, Buterin says that it is hard to 'fake' your position or consciously lie to others, on the basis that two processes happening concurrently on a PC makes the PC slower and more error-prone: _mutatis mutandi_ for humans running two competing computational or emotional processes (greed inside, virtuous altruism outside).\n\nIt's legitimate to want to question and put pressure on the use of machine learning results to frame human cognition, but for a psychoanalytically informed view of human being, there's something quite right about Buterin's formulation, if not the final destination or peregrinations of the intervening argument: Freud himself specifies that human cognition is marked or split by two parallel and coeval processes, which he called Primary (the unconscious) and Secondary (consciousness). Freud noted, as Buterin does, that these parallel processes indeed give rise to quite wild varieties of error and inefficiency\u00a0in human reality and human institutions.\n\nAnother source of pressure on Buterin's democratic ideals comes directly from anti-democratic republicans (I'm not referring to the US GOP/DNC political parties) who variously portray the public as a noisy, mad, unwashed, uneducated, irrational, emotional, possibly communist (or otherwise revolutionary) \"mob.\" I note in passing that these adjectives were\u2014and still are\u2014often applied to those in suffrage and freedom movements. An especially zesty anti-democrat might throw down a gauntlet such as: Should the nuclear reactors be staffed by public election, or even via chance appointment of public members?\u00a0Here one might wish to object that technology operations and political decision-making are separate realms, but that response begs the question, especially in light of today's scandals over large social media/technology organization's content moderation policies and the impact on political processes. Something deeper is therefore needed.\n\nWhat a psychoanalytic understanding of human being can provide is a corrective against both republican and democratic tendencies to exaggerate and romanticize human nature, either that of experts or the common person.\n\nIn the first place, I will note as I often do that democracy is what philosophers would call a regulatory or legislative ideal\u2014some argue the ultimate democracy, or equality of all in death, is the very ground of politics as such, the fatal calculus to which one recurs in deciding whether to obey or rebel (\"Give me liberty or give me death!\")\u2014and not a specifically realizable state or political form.\u00a0\n\nWhat would \"democracy\" look like, anyway? It is known that the political body in Attic democracy was not formed by public elections but by a \"drawing of lots\" (essentially, by raffle or a dice toss), combined with remarkably short terms of service from six to twelve months. Is this _more or less_ democratic than the systems of many elected parliamentary democracies today? The fact that democracies can only ever be described as _more or less_ democratic indicates that the formation of a political democracy is always a \"second-order\" action, one that in some sense always re-performs the ultimate democracy[1] of politics as such.\n\n|| > 1. But is \"the ultimate democracy\" really that of Death? This was Hegel's position: the Master-Slave or Lord-Bondsman dialectic only gives way at the brink of death, when one pulls back and each \"recognize\" the authority or submission of the other. This combat-oriented vision of dialectic (and politics in general) may however be rather partial or inadequate, since there are many claims for recognition which are not concluded by violent struggle, not even by proxy or 'at the limit,' as might be said. That is to say, there very much exist life-and-death consequences to many political struggles, but it is clearly not the case that all such struggles are terminated by life-or-death ultimatums, even by proxy or 'at the limit' (whatever that would mean). Perhaps there is therefore another 'ultimate democracy' to which humans appeal. (Even better in my opinion, more accurate to say: democracy ruins the ultimate, by 'imaging' the ultimate itself.)

Perhaps there is therefore another 'ultimate democracy' to which humans appeal. (Even better in my opinion, more accurate to say: democracy ruins the ultimate, by 'imaging' the ultimate itself.) Jacques Ranci\u00e8re has argued that this democracy is the democracy of the Intelligence: any meaningfully known or understood concept, no matter how rarefied or abstruse its content, must still be graspable by others. Indeed, before the \"equality of death\" which apparently governs the dialectical process of history, there must be some \"equality of understandings\" of the meaning of recognition, otherwise the struggle to death would always and everywhere prevail. Let us put it this way: Democracy as a political form or ideal appears to us as always-already _re-performed_, _encore_ (and _en corps_), first as Death, then as Intelligence. ||\n\nWhen humans bind themselves together in an organization of any sort\u2014that is, when they form a new image of life together\u2014they create or introduce into the world a second-order to their actions: now they not only perform this or that action, but they perform actions more or less well, that is, more or less in accord with their organization's image of life in common.\n\nEmerson's proviso in the epigraph to these notes can be taken as a corrective to the twin tendencies/temptations of democrats and republicans (again, not the US parties) with respect to democracy. That is, the democratic exaggeration might see in democracy a direct \"doubling\" of the lives of the political community, hence entirely absolving the need for representative structures, whereas the republican exaggeration sees in democracy inefficient and incompetent \"divisions\" of life and power.\n\nWhat I'm calling a psychoanalytic understanding of human being or human nature helps to check these tendencies and orient our political thinking along lines that cultivate flourishing over punishing waywardness, where possible, by furnishing an \"image of life\" that captures or corresponds to what is \"living\" in human life, i.e., desire.\n\nTo the republican nightmare of unruly mobs, psychoanalysis attests to the following fact: _every person thinks,_ every person is thinking about their lives. But even among groups of experts, there exists an opacity of consciousness to itself\u2014Freud called it the unconscious, but I've presented it above in terms of the splitting of pleasure and satisfaction, habit (homeostasis) and death drive. This fundamental opacity means that even groups of trained experts are susceptible to groupthink and 'corruption,' even in the absence of incentives or coercive measures for such.\n\nThis has to do with the \"scaling\" of human organizations. This scaling is never additive but multiplicative, and this multiplication can be (and probably often is) fractional, rarely a whole number. This is why we often find in democratic organizations (or in organizations that optimize for member\u00a0governance: \"of the people, by the people, for the people\") \"fractalized\" patterns of governance and control. (For more on this, check out Benoit Mandelbrot's _The Misbehavior of Markets_, which lays out many of his important insights on human organizations as fractional or fractal systems.)\u00a0Perhaps this is most evident in the experiment of the United States, with its national legislature, state legislatures, etc., followed by federal courts, state courts, etc., followed by national executive, state executives, etc. This \"nesting\" or fractalized system of governance may only be weakly to moderately ergodic\u2014this is often cited in the republicans' complaints: democracies have too much disorder, discord, and dissensus among their levels to govern effectively and decisively\u2014but the non-ergodicity of these structures may in fact be their most salient political value, since this is what guarantees their functional oversight of each other and the capacity to evolve in relation to a community.\n\nTo the democratic dream of total participation or perfect representation (which coincides with non-representation), psychoanalysis provides the following reminder: _every person enjoys,_ and enjoyment (or satisfaction) disturbs the habits of body and mind you wish to perfect. Here a deeper detour into psychoanalysis can be instructive (see also Slavoj Zizek\u2019s _For They Know Not What They Do: Enjoyment as a Political Factor_). Where, after all, does enjoyment (either as opposed to pleasure, or as surplus-pleasure) come from? It comes from the 'symbolic' operations in infantile life: not only does milk satisfy the infant's hunger, but a symbolic excess attaches to the act of feeding, such that, e.g., the suckling action at the bottle or breast, the way you're held, or the sounds in the background can all become obscure points of fixation and surplus-pleasure or enjoyment. The infant is induced into symbolic operations because of our species' premature birth and chronic neoteny, or what Freud calls the \"radical helplessness\" (_Hilflosigkeit_) of the human being, our dependence on a parent/neighbor/helper.\u00a0\n\nThis disturbance of\u00a0surplus-pleasure mandates a quota of representational or symbolic operation because the infant cannot contain or \"bind\" all of its pleasure in physical processes. Thus commences the child's slow crawl toward the acquisition of language, the negation-fueled fantasies of puberty, and the allegedly \"adult\" world of reason. When humans come together in an organization, they are still individually guided by the contingencies in their development.\n\nHere comes finally my big idea or proposition:\u00a0DAOs\u2014successful public DAOs, anyway, like other successful public institutions\u2014must be able to achieve or facilitate something like a 'psychoanalysis' of their members, in order for those members to evaluate their actions in terms of the organization's image of a common life.\n\nIn many cases, especially where organizational membership is voluntary and the scope of activities is somewhat restricted, this process is often already done (if imperfectly) by society: one's enjoyments already attune one to \"becoming,\" say, a mathematician or Democrat.\n\nBut for DAOs that cannot readily count on members who've been similarly socialized and/or for DAOs with scopes of action that may be large, variable, or cross multiple specializations, how they on-board new members and facilitate adoption will be of some consequence, especially when decisions are made by vote.\n\nOne solution for DAOs may be to set up a \"bootcamp\" or \"orientation\" process for new members. The wisdom of this solution is ancient; Machiavelli would take it for granted that one can convert the ethical habits of individuals into the broader \u00a0_customs_ of a society, which themselves, when sufficiently coherent and organized, can become a _state._\n\nThe purpose of linking DAOs to psychoanalysis is that DAOs, like analysis, can powerfully disrupt and reconfigure the transitions between habits, customs, and states\u2014they are capable of reaching \"beyond the pleasure principle,\" that is, beyond the sickly homeostasis of financialization.\u00a0\n\nYet DAOs can only do this by being mindful of their representational excesses (i.e., their representative/organizational structure), and especially of being mindful of the uneven representational excesses that a decentralized membership\u00a0brings with it. Developing ways for DAOs to operate _through_ the ambiguity of differences of opinion and contradictory priorities\u2014put differently: for DAOs to _listen_ to their members, even when members barely speak the same language or are of patently different socializations\u2014through thoughtful governance designs, uniquely possible on blockchain, will be crucial to DAOs' survival as public institutions and will determine how DAOs challenge existing public institutions to reform. That is, if DAOs (and crypto more generally) introduce new digital freedoms to the (physical or political) body, many of which are still barely understood and little articulated, they will have to possess some means of addressing the unruly motor of human motivation to properly \"suffuse\" this freedom throughout the body. This is why novel or refined voting systems and governance/decision-making processes are key to the DAO concept, if not its hallmarks.\n\nthis is a cool point. i think <@753720709032968213> has shared before papers about designing systems explicitly for conflict that i am reminded of from this\n\nAlso in connection to this point is the historian of science Georges Canguilhem's argument that the \"health\" of an organism is not its fixity to a norm, as though sickness were the fall from or a lack of a norm\u2014in fact, sicknesses very often establish their own homeostatic equilibrium. Canguilhem thus says that the health of an organism should be defined as its capacity to establish new norms, rather than its adherence to one.\n\nOne point I plan to develop further: what is the relation between organ, organism, and organization? How does life enter or filter out of these entities? To read on this front: Pierre Klossowski's _Living Currency_ and Michael Marder's _Hegel's Energy_, both somewhat philosophical takes on biological or libidinal energetics and social economics.\n\nAlston has written about \"governance through conflict\": https://law.mit.edu/pub/governanceasconflict/release/1\n\nThere's something about the definition of \"shared values\" as the ground of an organization or group that sticks out to me as needing some (or maybe a lot of) scrutiny, but it doesn't make much difference within Alston's argument at large. \n\nBut in response to the claim that \"sufficiently shared values lead to a common purpose that constitutes an organization,\" I would say that values are rarely the sole or main criteria for membership in a group/organization. Moreover, a common purpose can be defined independently of shared values, although shared values may indeed contribute greatly to the legitimacy and long-term acceptance of this purpose. In fact, the common purpose can determine the shared values, rather than the reverse. For example I think it would be difficult to determine the \"shared values\" of a citizenry in a way that would be prior to or constitutive of their purpose (survival).\n\nBeing able to define and use shared values to navigate conflict is a powerful governance tool\u2014hence the importance of an organization's Constitutional design\u2014but there may still be an outstanding question of how to navigate _conflicting values_ under a shared purpose. Or this may just be terminological, I haven't decided.\n\nThinking a little more about it... Alston might say navigation of a conflict of values would need to be channeled through an organization's/constitution's amendment process. <a:hmmPizza:1050825992609988609>\n\nOnce again I am going to have Eric read these thoughts. He\u2019s going to be thrilled! I\u2019m at a conf with him this weekend in Berkeley.\n\nDo you perchance know if he works with DAOs only on commission? At NetaDAO we're nearing the end of our Operating Agreement/Constitution deliberations, though I still need to write up the subDAO articles and some other important odds and ends. We'll be looking for external reviewers and very probably an attorney to go over the details (attorney can add all the whatever legal verbiage).\n\nI can ask!\n\nre: \"shared values\" as the ground of an organization, Ranci\u00e8re says: \"One could say that the existence of politics is always conflictual, and never based on anything like consensual organization or delegation. We live under regimes that purport to be regimes of consensual delegation, but in reality what we call 'politics' is a conflict between two antagonistic principles\" (_Politics and Aesthetics_, 28). So the limit of shared values as an organizational ground might be those organizations that are 'political' (political _rather than what?_ perhaps rather than for-profit?).\n\nhttps://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rubin-Democracy.pdf\n\n\"A Theory of Democracy for the Administrative State\" by Edward Rubin (wip) -- some very interesting overall thoughts and historical interventions on organizational life and governance... has some nice tie-ins with Rubin's book _State, Soul, and Society_ that looks at how modern states developed alongside a modern ethos of self-fulfillment and individual liberty (today somewhat discredited or otherwise distanced by 'postmodern' emphases on pastiche and copying, irony and anxiety, etc.).\n\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/2095101 \n\nthis is a classic paper that argues \"institutional isomorphism\" (institutiones that look like each other) find it easier to interact.\n\ni've argued that DAO DAO makes it easier to confederate (https://www.else.how/p/mondragon-lessons-for-dao-dao). this paper gives me some better language to talk about this thesis. \"the iron cage revisited\" talks about isomorphism inside the organization - DAO DAO is about isomorphism at the organization's *edges* - purchase orders, payroll, and other things that have no trans-institutional representation today are given trans-institutional representation on-chain by DAO DAO and the primitives it picks. \n\noverall, this paper gives me hope that a bit of DAO DAO adoption can start a 'flywheel' - organizations that use DAO DAO will find it easier to work with other organizations that use DAO DAO.\n\noooo\n\nThanks for sharing this! I wonder if institutional isomorphism is related to what I think of as the inevitability of organizational fractalization.\u00a0Benoit Mandelbrot would ask: Why do rivers look like tree branches, and the veins of tree leaves look like rivers? But we can just as well ask: Why do governments have 'national' or top-level forms that tend to be replicated (in structure or form, though typically not in scope or purpose) downward\u2014presidents, governors, mayors... Supreme Court, circuit court, state court, county court, city court... and so on?\n\nPerhaps any organization of \"power,\" be it biological, social, militaristic, economic, etc., tends to roughly recapitulate itself beyond a certain scale.

(Leo Bersani:\u00a0\"We exist, in both time and space, in a vast network of *near-sameness,* a network characterized by relations of inaccurate replication. Accurate replication\u2014the perfect identity of terms\u2014is an attempted human correction of these correspondences, a fantasy of specularity in the place of correspondence.\")\n\nI will note: the term \"isomorphism\" here surprised me, since my academic work began in mathematics and I still reserve \"isomorphism\" for one-to-one structure-preserving maps/functions; the use here is\u00a0\n\n> a constraining process that forces one unit in population to resemble other units that face the same set of environmental conditions.\n\nTherefore I think another potential candidate for describing or contextualizing this process of inaccurate replication, given the emphasis on organizations responding to their \"environment,\" could be Darwinian \"selection\"[1]\u2014tho I want to shy away from unqualified/naive analogies between the organic and the organizational. For me, this space \"between\" the organic and the organizational corresponds to the space \"between\" the physical and the symbolic, the natural and the cultural: the point is not to permanently segregate them, nor to proclaim them as all and one, but to grapple with their emulsive immiscibilities.\n\nYou write:\u00a0\"DAO DAO is about isomorphism at the organization's edges - purchase orders, payroll, and other things that have no trans-institutional representation today are given trans-institutional representation on-chain by DAO DAO and the primitives it picks.\"\n\nThis seems to me a way of saying that DaoDao unlocks new 'environmental' possibilities for institutional/organizational life, new centers and peripheries of power and resistance, new schemes for representational techniques. It may be as hard for us to forecast the development and uses of these representational powers as it would have been for the first speakers of language to predict Marcel Proust, but I think you are eminently correct that DaoDao is capable of starting a \"flywheel\" of organizational usage, adoption, and change.\n\nIn 2015, Buterin speculated that DAOs will facilitate the formation of \"superrational\" organisms/organizations that, via their public ledgers, will replace credentialized systems of trust and punishment with measurable \"virtue\" and enticements to further virtuous/virtuoso performances. Whether this was overly optimistic or naive, the possibility to use blockchain to reform the life of institutions is closer today than ever before thanks to the work of DaoDao and its contributors, and it's why I'm glad to have NetaDAO as a place to really experiment with the idea of a public institution for the Interchain. <a:dance:1035704193891188836>\n\n1. To be sure, even within Darwinian theory, there are those who completely neglect that his theory of \"selection\" is internally split, i.e., between natural and sexual selection. Sexual selection produces 'apparently' unnecessary and even counter-to-survival results\u2014think of the peacock's feathers\u2014without which however survival would risk becoming flat and meaningless, or anyway much less libidinally satisfying. One could approach this from Hegel's observation that the rational concept of \"bird\" necessitates only one kind, whereas reality abounds with birds upon birds\u2014thus something in natural\u00a0being, or life, manifestly distorts and/or fails to correspond to the logic of rational/economic efficacy, or mere survival.\u00a0\n\nThis variety and multiplicity of the natural, or life, suppurates\u00a0the sameness of rationality. No doubt this fact was at the base of the ancient intuition held by Heraklitus and others that \"Nature encrypts itself,\" or more literally: nature\u00a0_loves_ encryption, nature loves to hide. With some libations, or in an especially speculative mood, I might claim that what nature fundamentally encrypts is the social itself, i.e., the social life of plants and animals and the deep mysteries of speciation.\n\nThe real mystery of organizational life might lie in how shared purpose nevertheless accommodates and gives rise to discrepant values. I think of such organizations as the school, where teachers are in principle all committed to providing the best education for students, yet can have various and even opposed values on how that's best achieved. Navigating the discrepancy or conflict of values is really the core of governance in these cases, and I think I would be more persuaded that organizations _invent and compel_ shared values in response to crises, rather than drawing upon them, and that the possibilities of scope and scale for this creative and coercive action is determinative of organizational life.\n\nThis would correspond to Jean-Luc Nancy's argument in _The Truth of Democracy_ (https://www.oddweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Nancy-The-Truth-of-Democracy.pdf) that the true \"common\" is not a blanket under which \"we all\" shelter\u2014some property we all hold in common\u2014but _a blank_ which stubbornly eludes us and which we all must ultimately fill in for ourselves.\n\nhttps://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003331780-4/law-unto-peter-hallward\n\n> As its usage in compounds like automation and autocracy also suggests, the \u2018auto\u2019 or \u2018self\u2019 of autonomy is ambiguous, and helps to mark the concept off from related notions of freedom and independence. What kind of actor can freely lay down a law for itself, a law in the strict, universal and commanding sense of the term? Who is the self of self-legislation? Without wanting to delve too deeply into the canonical history of European philosophy here, I think Kant\u2019s famous and uncompromising answer to this question helpfully foregrounds its conscious and voluntarist dimensions, but it unhelpfully abstracts the moral actor from all constitutive social relations, investing it in pure practical reason. Hegel\u2019s rejoinder to Kant certainly recovers the relational and plural quality of a political actor, but also diminishes its capacity to act, and to legislate, by dispersing it across the general spirit that both animates a legitimate state and \u2018disposes\u2019 its members in a law-abiding hierarchy. Rousseau\u2019s emphasis on popular sovereignty and participatory law-making, by contrast, helps clarify what\u2019s at stake in the ongoing struggle for autonomy, a struggle understood as an essentially collective effort that pits a mass community of equals against any kind of domineering elite.\n\n\n\n<:pog:1034269207594020864>\n\nEnjoying this so far. I would say that they present \"institutional analysis\" in the same way I was thinking that DAOs could psychoanalyze the social, i.e., by revealing their latent or 'unconscious' mechanisms of action: \"The problem with this way of looking at the issue of rural land conflicts in Brazil [i.e., as a deficit of revolutionary political will] is that it focuses on the upfront manifestations of the actions of players, but does not consider the institutional foundations that determine the players' incentives and constraints\" (5). \n\nAlston et al eschew non-institutional analyses for getting caught up in symptoms of social disorder and ignoring their common cause, e.g., in Brazil, the federal branch is empowered to redistribute land to the landless, but the judiciary's scope is simply to enforce legislation (property right)\u2014so the endless conflict over land comes from the authorization of two public institutions of authority whose relations are not 'properly' or fully delineated. Now some might read that inconsistency as cynical gamesmanship, \"the conspiracy of capitalists\" as it were, but this hardly explains why other countries that are even more capitalistic are not also plunged into perpetual broad-scale land disputes.\n\nhttps://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/06/when-new-york-city-really-was-run-from-a-smoke-filled-room.html\n\nHi from New York!
